One day before the Nonprofit Technology Conference, [Code for America](http://codeforamerica.org), [TechSoup](http://www.techsoup.org/) and [Caravan Studios](http://www.caravanstudios.org/) are teaming up to help solve community problems with the help of technology. ![](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/3669313/2225081/283f1ba8-9a87-11e3-9564-a6053ab5bf62.jpg)

On March 12 from 10:00 a.m. &#8211; 5:00 p.m. at the [1776 coworking space](http://1776dc.com/contact), we&#8217;re welcoming community members, developers, designers, and researchers to collaborate on applications for social good. Our morning sessions will feature an idea generator where participants will brainstorm problem statements to inform the hack request process. In the afternoon we&#8217;ll switch gears and host an open demo session for those hackers who are ready for community feedback on their social good-related apps and products.

Food and beverages and there&#8217;s no need to attend the entire day. To register visit [http://bit.ly/1bqfDJO](http://www.eventbrite.com/e/dc-nonprofit-generator-accessing-ideas-for-social-benefit-technology-apps-tickets-10633518139).
