We&#8217;re excited to kick off the second stage of the Great American Civic Hack: a three month campaign to take our favorite open source, civic repos to the next level; to close issues, reach milestones, add new features, and generally make code fork and merge ready.

In May, we put out a call for repos. We asked for repos we could organize to work on as a national network and invited people to vote on which repos they&#8217;d like to see featured. We&#8217;re excited to announce the repos we&#8217;ll be working on as a national community this summer:

  1. CKAN
  2. LocalWiki
  3. Procure.io
  4. We The People
  5. Councilmatic
  6. OpenTreeMap
  7. Brigade Platform

**How can you get involved on a national project?**

  1. [Learn about the featured repos](https://docs.google.com/a/codeforamerica.org/document/d/1QcUrUcAHu8eYXdLT7VeX0uLBlkKdCRKwWKYnoyN63qY/edit#).
  2. Fork &#8216;em.
  3. Close issues.
  4. Issue pulls.
  5. Not a coder? [Help test features or add or edit documentation processes](https://docs.google.com/a/codeforamerica.org/document/d/1QcUrUcAHu8eYXdLT7VeX0uLBlkKdCRKwWKYnoyN63qY/edit#).

**How can you get involved locally?**

In addition to these select repos, Brigades across the country will be working on local repos for their communities as a part of the campaign. If you&#8217;d like us to track your local repo during the campaign, showcase your progress, and reward you if you accomplish your goals, [submit your local repo](http://brigade.codeforamerica.org/civic-coding) before June 15, 2013.
