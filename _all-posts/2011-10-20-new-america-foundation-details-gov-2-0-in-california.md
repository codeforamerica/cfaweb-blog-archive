This morning the New America Foundation [released a comprehensive Gov 2.0 report](http://newamerica.net/publications/policy/hear_us_now) about how California&#8217;s local governments are using technology to connect with the public and improve services. [&#8220;Hear Us Now? A California Survey of Digital Technology&#8217;s Role in Civic Engagement and Local Government&#8221;](http://newamerica.net/publications/policy/hear_us_now) is a survey of 41 different innovations from across the state, including:

  * <span style="direction: ltr;">The San Ramon Valley Fire Protection District&#8217;s text-message network to tap CPR-certified citizens when someone nearby reports a cardiac event.</span>
  * <span style="direction: ltr;">Riverside County&#8217;s use of digital channels to provide farmers with detailed weather data to promote more efficient irrigation and higher crop yields.</span>
  * <span style="direction: ltr;">Santa Cruz&#8217;s participatory budget process, San Francisco&#8217;s open-data clearinghouse, and more.</span>

One of the reportâ€™s top recommendations is for communities to implement a version of the Federal IT Dashboard, which [Civic Commons helped the OMB open source](http://civiccommons.org/2011/03/it-dashboard-open-sourced/) earlier this year. The Dashboard tracks government technology spending &#8212; allowing the public to monitor how money is being spent. Earlier this year, it was estimated that the IT Dashboard had saved $3 billion. The New America Foundation recommended using the IT Dashboard as tool to track performance measures and metrics. There&#8217;s even a [Change.org petition going around](www.change.org/petitions/tell-san-francisco-city-leaders-bring-the-it-dashboard-to-city-hall) now to encourage the City of San Francisco to implement the Dashboard.

Also, for those of you in the Bay Area, you can attend an Oct. 26 event at Stanford University, where the report will be discussed with policy experts and government officials; [RSVP here](http://zocalopublicsquare.org/upcoming.php?event_id=489). Code for America will be there talking about some of our projects in the context of the report.
