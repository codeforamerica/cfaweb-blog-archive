As the deadline for [applications](http://www.formstack.com/forms/?1018282-aijP78y1c7) for the [2012 Code for America City Program](http://codeforamerica.org/cities) is approaching, we&#8217;ve been fortunate to get some attention in the press around our program and this movement.

> The interest in this tech-age brand of populism has attracted both activists and entrepreneurs — and people who straddle both worlds.
> 
> One effort launched this year, Code for America, recruits technology developers and entrepreneurs before they enter lucrative careers, persuading them to give a year of service in exchange for a stipend. Boston, Philadelphia, Seattle and Washington, D.C, are hosting fellows this year. New York City officials have met with the organization about the possibility of being included in the program next year.

> &#8230;a project called [Code for America](http://codeforamerica.org/) is starting its first round of community activism this year, focusing on Boston; Washington, D.C.; Philadelphia; and Seattle. Code for America sends five researchers, coders and planners into cities to interview community leaders, block captains and average joes about problems they face, and then the programmers develop software solutions based on the findings.

> Code for America aims to create lasting relationships between community leaders and government officials, said Abhi Nemani, the organization’s director of strategy and communications.
> 
> “It’s a fact of life,” Nemani said. “Almost all cities are facing budget crises now and they’re finding they need to change the way they provide services. This is a great way to be more strategic and smart about how they allocate funds.&#8221;

> One of the Philadelphia fellows, Matt Lewis, is taking a year off from his career to work on Code for America. “A lot of us are interested in making our city governments work better. It was too good of an opportunity to turn down,” Lewis said.

> &#8230;the conversations and relationships that these fellows create are meant to reverberate across and bolster every city’s movement toward greater transparency through technology.

> “…One very important long tail is the nation. Our project is going to serve Philadelphia, but it’s also openly shared with anyone who wants to use it, any city that has a common problem that our project can solve,” said Pete Fecteau, 27, who was previously working with the Salvation Army near his home in Grand Rapids, Mich&#8230;
> 
> A big selling point of the program is meant to be cost: big impact through technology talent on the cheap.
> 
> The City of Philadelphia is paying $225,000, which covers stipends for the fellows, says [CFA lead organizer Jen Pahlka](http://technicallyphilly.com/2011/02/2010/04/16/code-for-american-founder-jennifer-pahlka-on-bringing-open-government-help-to-philadelphia), “although the city is already seeing benefits over and above the project they are assigned to do, primarily cost savings from process improvements the fellows are able to implement during their year of service. There are also intangible benefits to the city in exposure to agile development methods and lean startup approaches to problem solving in a civic context. ”
> 
> That cost is nothing compared to the kind of impact and return on investment that the city gets in return, says Division of Technology Chief of Staff Jeff Friedman. Friedman says the kind of service CFA is offering would cost the city closer to $1.48 million in consulting costs. CFA, which handles other costs, like travel, is funded, as Pahlka says, “by individuals, corporations and most significantly by foundations including the Knight Foundation and the Omidyar Network.”
