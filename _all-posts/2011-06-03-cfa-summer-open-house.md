<img src="http://codeforamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/cfa-sign.png" alt="" title="cfa-sign" class="alignright size-full wp-image-6019" />Summer is upon us at Code for America! How do I know this, you may ask, since the weather in San Francisco has been so&#8230;well, un-summerlike (read: foggy, cold, and yes even rainy!)?  Why, it’s because we have our summer interns starting on Monday! And they will certainly brighten our spirits despite Mother Nature! We are so excited to have them start, and we’re kicking off the season and celebrating the interns starting with a Summer Open House on Tuesday, June 7 @ 5:30pm, in our lovely SoMA office space, [provided by Cisco](http://codeforamerica.org/2011/03/25/home-sweet-home-thanks-to-cisco/). All of our teams will be demo-ing the latest on their [projects](http://codeforamerica.org/cities/), so in addition to enjoying some light bites, a cocktail and conversation, you’ll be able to get up to speed on our work and what we’ve been up to the last few months. We hope you can join us!
