I have worked in both the private and public sectors and have experienced the technological gap that exists in governments. I want to participate in Code for America because working in local government for the past five years I have a passion for technology in government. I understand what Government 2.0, Web 2.0 and the need to provide more services to the public. I&#8217;m passionate at developing and managing projects that enhance government services. Most importantly I want to change the way the public views government. The public often views government as inefficient and unresponsive. This is a chance to help change government and make it more efficient using technology.

At the City of Santa Clarita I to worked on and managed numerous projects to enhance the services the city provides. I have worked on projects such as our web site redesign, graffiti tracking database and our social media outreach. In 2010, we were recognized by the California Association of Public Information Officers with an award for Excellence in Communications for the <MayorDude.com> web site. This web site encouraged the youth of Santa Clarita to get involved with local government by submitting questions and suggestions to the mayor.

I have first hand experience in developing and managing software applications at the local government level. I want to participate in Code for America so I can bring the skills and knowledge that I have gained in technology at the City of Santa Clarita and help others.
