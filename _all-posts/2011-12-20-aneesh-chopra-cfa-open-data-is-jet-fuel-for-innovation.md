As the United States Chief Technology Officer, Aneesh Chopra is our nation&#8217;s chief geek. On a recent trip to San Francisco, he chose Code for America to convene local tech leaders along with our 2011 Fellows, to lay out a vision for how open data will fuel American innovation.

Chopra is a force of nature. We&#8217;ve heard reports that he writes his email in binary code. We admit that&#8217;s probably White House folklore. However, what is undeniable is Chopra&#8217;s ability to command a room chock-full of civic geeks, and his unparalled ability to facilitate collaboration between technologists for public good.
