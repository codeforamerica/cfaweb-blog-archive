More than [30,000](http://code-for-america-brigade.meetup.com/) people around the globe help make their communities and governments work better through the [Code for America network](http://www.codeforamerica.org/brigade/). Here&#8217;s a brief snapshot of what happened across the network this week:

### Open Source Mentorship Program Maps Philly&#8217;s Arts Grants

[Code for Philly](https://codeforphilly.org/) partnered with [Girl Develop It](https://www.girldevelopit.com/) to create the [Open Source Mentorship Program](http://technical.ly/philly/2015/09/10/open-source-mentorship-philadelphia-women/). The program offers women a crash course in open source and hands-on project experience in civic tech. [Christina Deemer](http://cdeemer.com/), a 2015 program participant, made a [map of where arts grants have been awarded](https://osmp2015.github.io/map-app/cultural-fund-map/) in Philly.

### Research Reveals Rewards of Local Government Work with Brigades

[John Stephens](http://www.sog.unc.edu/about/faculty-and-staff/john-b-stephens), a member of [Code for Durham](http://codefordurham.com/) and Professor of Public Administration and Government at UNC-Chapel Hill, researched [how government and brigades work together](http://johnthered.tumblr.com/post/128280326911/civic-tech-brigades-government-connections). Through a series of interviews with the North Carolina Brigade government partners, John uncovered [14 rewarding aspects](http://johnthered.tumblr.com/post/128280326911/civic-tech-brigades-government-connections) as well as a few challenges governments encounter when working with brigades.

### Website Translates Government Forms, Wins PennApps Civic Tech Track

[PennApps](http://2015f.pennapps.com/), the country&#8217;s largest college hackathon, took place over Labor Day Weekend. This year PennApps added a civic technology track, and the winner was a website that [helps non-English speakers fill out government forms](http://devpost.com/software/pennapps-hack).

### Code for New River Valley Helps Voters Understand District Changes

The boundaries of voting districts in Montgomery County, Virginia changed this year. [Code for New River Valley](http://codefornrv.org/) created [interactive maps](http://codefornrv.github.io/did-my-district-change/#details) to help voters understand the district changes by showing the new and old boundaries.

### Adventures in FOIL: The Freedom of Information Law and NYC Condos

Chris Whong, former co-captain of [Beta.NYC](http://beta.nyc), wrote about his experience [requesting public information from the New York State Attorney General&#8217;s Office](http://chriswhong.com/local/adventures-in-foil-new-york-condominium-offering-plans/) through the FOIL process. His efforts to get information on NYC condominium offering plans involved a lot of paper records and correspondence via mail. Based on his experience, Chris recommends the AG&#8217;s office store offering plans electronically and make them available instantly over the web.
