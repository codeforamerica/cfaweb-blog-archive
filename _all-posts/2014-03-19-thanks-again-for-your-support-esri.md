Here at Code for America, we’re coming to a critical point in our history — we’ve proven ourselves as a successful startup nonprofit, scaling in a broader and more deliberate way. That growth is made possible by the generous partners who donate to and sponsor CfA. [Esri](http://www.esri.com) has been one of our most consistent allies, working with us for the fourth year in a row.

**A Strong Partnership**

In 2014, Code for America will continue to work with Esri. Their support began with CodeAcross 2014. Esri sponsored 48 community CodeAcross events, empowering 2,500 people to come together to prototype civic applications, inventory datasets, and draft open data policies. We’re excited to embark on another yearlong partnership with Esri — kicking off the collaboration, last week we had past and current Fellows attend <a title="devsummit" href="http://www.esri.com/events/devsummit" target="_blank">Esri’s International Developer Summit</a>.

2014 Fellow and GIS developer Lyzi Diamond enjoyed the conference:

“I&#8217;ve been using Esri software for a long time, and it&#8217;s really cool to see the new projects and developer tools that are coming down the pipe. There&#8217;s also an educational component here at DevSummit that&#8217;s pretty rad: the presentations are about new tools and products, but also have a focus on helping people who have been in the Esri space for a long time adapt to these new systems and try out the new tools.”

In addition to learning from and working with our developers, Esri will support collaboration between local government staff members through the <a title="pn" href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/about/peernetwork/" target="_blank">Peer Network</a>, and will participate as a sponsoring partner at our annual <a title="summit" href="http://cfasummit.org/" target="_blank">Summit</a>.

“A large part of Code for America’s success comes from the strategic partnerships we make in the civic tech community,” notes Bob Sofman, CfA’s Executive Director. “We’re constantly energized and inspired by our collaboration with Esri, and look forward to seeing what we can achieve together in 2014.”

Esri is also supporting CfA by donating subscriptions of ArcGIS Online and the Esri Developer Network (EDN) to the 2014 fellows. Additionally, members of the Esri team will be providing a training to the Fellows at the CfA office on Monday, March 24. This training will be available for viewing online after March 24 for and CfA members who are interested in learning how to use Esri tools.

“We continue to support Code for America because I believe in computational innovation. I believe in what it means to make cities more efficient, open, transparent, and democratic,” says Esri president Jack Dangermond.

Thanks Esri! We look forward to another great year.

**In related news,** Esri president Jack Dangermond is presenting at an event at the White House today in support of the President’s Climate Data Initiative, a project with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) highlighting how open data can power technologies to help communities prepare for the impacts of climate change.

Esri has launched a [Climate Resilience App Challenge](http://www.esri.com/esri-news/releases/14-1qtr/esri-announces-climate-resilience-app-challenge-2014) calling for developers to create an app using the Esri ArcGIS Platform to help communities see, understand, and prepare for climate risks. Esri will select up to three winners who will be featured at the Esri International User Conference. The deadline is June 2; for more information, visit [esri.com/climate-app](http://www.esri.com/software/landing_pages/climate-app "climate").
