It&#8217;s a matter of life or death and each second counts.

Whereas in the past, you&#8217;d have to wait for first responders with knowledge of the nearest AED to come for help, new technology &#8212; like the [San Ramon Fire Department&#8217;s Save a Life app](http://firedepartment.mobi/) &#8212; enables trained citizens anywhere to be called into action, with a notification of nearby emergency and information on the closest AED. The San Ramon app has [already saved lives](http://sanramon.patch.com/articles/fire-district-adds-life-saving-cpr-dispatch-to-iphone-app-makes-app-available-to-other-fire-departments). Clearly, this app has tremendous potential to help citizens &#8212; and not just in San Ramon. Every city could benefit from this kind of technology; however, for it to work, there needs to be an up-to-date, reliable, and open database of AED locations. Fortunately, a group of urbanists and technologists &#8212; including Javier Muniz of Granicus and Adriel Hampton of NationBuilder &#8212; have come together to build and the tech needed to crowdsource that data.

But they need your help. The app has been <a href="https://github.com/gov20cto/huzzah" target="_blank">prototyped</a>, and they are continuing development. This weekend (December 10 & 11), at the [CityCampSF hackathon](http://www.wiredtoshare.com/citycampsf_hackathon), [you can join them](http://www.wiredtoshare.com/open_aed_finder) in making this important, much needed application a reality.
