This week, our Communities team is in Berlin as part of [Open Knowledge 2014](http://2014.okfestival.org/) and to hold Code for All’s first Annual Meeting. We’ve brought together all of our partners and representatives from like-minded organizations &#8212; 75 people from almost 20 countries &#8212; to finally meet face-to-face and collaboratively devise a game-plan for how we can be more impactful in our work to advance civic technology on a global scale.

This community gathering couldn’t come at a better time as we take stock of the last year of work with Code for All and celebrate the release of our first annual [Code for All report](http://codeforamerica.org/about/international/2013-annual-report/). We’ve learned a lot, from building apps to tackle agricultural theft in Jamaica to expanding civic tech in Germany.

Code for All, an international network of civic innovators who are helping to transform their own communities by using technology to improve government and foster citizen engagement, was convened by Code for America in 2013 and started with four founding members &#8212; Code for America, Code for the Caribbean, Codigo DF (Code for Mexico City), and Code for DE Labs (Code for Germany). Our initial and continued goal is to learn by doing and together build the foundation for a truly global network.

One year later our network includes partners in 11 countries and we’re growing.

Civic technology efforts sometimes happen in isolation, particularly at the international level. As a movement, through a global network, we can take advantage of opportunities to learn from each other, build off of each other’s work, and improve our own efforts at local levels around the world. Our continued exchange will not only help us to understand what’s working well, but what remaining challenges exist that we can tackle together.

We believe that all of our work will be better because we are connected.

We hope the Code for All Annual Report offers a resource to those coming together in Berlin this week, and that it serves as an ongoing reference to those joining remotely and others who hope to get started on implementing civic technology in their own communities soon.
