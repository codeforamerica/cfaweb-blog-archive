The name &#8220;Code for America&#8221; is a little misleading: CfA needs more than coders, and its coders must do more than code. We need civic hackers, yes. But we also need researchers, project managers, and designers experienced in [UI and UX](http://uxmag.com/strategy/the-citizen-experience-needs-us). We need [fellows](http://codeforamerica.org/apply) who can [understand government](http://codeforamerica.org/2011/03/09/diving-into-cities-440-interviews/), and fellows who can [understand each other.](http://codeforamerica.org/2011/04/04/understanding-the-engagement-toolkit/) And if you fit any one of those categories but can&#8217;t write a line of CSS, that&#8217;s no problem &#8212; [apply now](http://codeforamerica.org/apply). (The deadline is coming up: July 31!) Because we wanted to try to make this point as clearly as possible, Scott Silverman, one of our fellows, put together a poster we&#8217;re hanging up in our office, front and center:

[Download the poster as a PDF](https://docs.google.com/a/codeforamerica.org/viewer?a=v&pid=explorer&chrome=true&srcid=0B2QcDvAmw5VANGE3ZDg0MWUtYzFlYi00YWQ3LWFiYmItNTAwOWY3ZTEzN2Rh&hl=en_US) and spread the word.
