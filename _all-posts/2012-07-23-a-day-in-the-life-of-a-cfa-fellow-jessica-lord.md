Each morning I hear an alarm. I turn it off and then sleep for another length of time that changes each morning. Pre-CfA I was a girl on a schedule and that included breakfast and coffee at home. Now I&#8217;m a snoozer and a picker-upper of things at the fantastic corner market, [Courntey&#8217;s Produce](http://www.yelp.com/biz/courtney-produce-ii-san-francisco), near my place.

My mornings always start atop the hill at 14th and Castro with a view of the East Bay. I&#8217;m actually moving to Oakland this week so my heart swells with excitement when I see her sunny shores.

I ride a bike in (and everywhere). Biking is great!

It&#8217;s barely a 10 minute ride to work. When I get to the office the first challenge is: What about that cake on the extraordinary cake-spawning-table you walk by on the way to the coffee pot? Today the table spawned some kind of spice cake with cream cheese frosting. I was able to resist until about 3pm.

After coffee and hellos to other fellows I make my way up to the Focus Zone. I&#8217;m not sure what it&#8217;s offcially called, but that&#8217;s what happens there. It&#8217;s a good thing. Some days are meetings and many small taks and somedays are for production. The pigeons nesting outside the window upstairs have not been alerted that this is the Focus Zone. Time to focus. Now.

Twenty-six travel schedules means that sometimes the office can end up rather empty. This is nice on production days. I walk down the street and get some food to take back to my desk and keep on keeping on. Teriyaki chicken and veggie sushi &#8211; because seafood is GROSS. I mean, haven&#8217;t you seen it? Ew.

This is what my production-mode area looks like. It has all the essentials. Distress calls to New York&#8217;s finest on Law and Order provides background noise, water and tea keep me churning (you don&#8217;t want to know what happens if I don&#8217;t switch to tea after the morning&#8217;s coffee), and CSS is all over the place. Even on that paper there. Not kidding.

My post-work life is currently not so glamorous. The aforementioned move to Oakland means evenings of packing, and well, frankly I&#8217;d rather eat fish.
