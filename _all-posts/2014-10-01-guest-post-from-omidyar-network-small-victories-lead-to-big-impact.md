> This is a blog post by Omidyar Network, a yearlong supporter of Code for America and philanthropic donor for the [2014 Code for America Summit](http://cfasummit.com). 

On the heels of the 2014 Code for America Summit, it feels like the perfect moment to reflect on the progress made in municipal innovation over the past four years. There is a tremendous amount of work to still be done, but the conversations are changing, in large part because public servants are adopting the open government ethos and [doing the hard work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF8zNOdnO84&#038;list=PL65XgbSILalWFStqV0z0N9pvftstJ8AAh&#038;index=34) of culture change inside City Hall. 

In 2011 I was working as CfA’s government relations director, and we struggled to get local governments to participate in our first Summit. Not because government partners didn’t support CfA’s work, rather rationalizing a travel budget for the Summit was insurmountable for most. Fast forward three years to this year’s Summit: representatives from more than 100 different governments were in attendance. That’s progress. I’ve always found victories in things as small as government staffers prioritizing travel budgets for convenings like the Code for America Summit. Not only does it indicate that there’s an understanding of the value of the network, it also means that CfA’s government partners are better able to articulate that value and secure elusive travel funding. 

Small victories are the foundation of Code for America’s work, and civic innovation more generally. The projects and products launched in CfA cities through the Fellowship and Brigade highlight how addressing seemingly intractable civic challenges can be tackled in small, yet effective, ways that lead to real impact. For example, in Rhode Island, [Golden Ticket](http://codeforamerica.org/governments/rhodeisland), a website for parents, makes it easier to register toddlers in lotteries for the government sponsored pre-Kindergarten program. Easier registration in the lottery results in more parents registering for pre-K services, and thus, more children in pre-K programs. 

Now, we’re seeing these small victories everywhere. We’re seeing it with procurement &#8212; more specifically with procurement improvement. Although we’re still far from a proper reform of the process, people and governments alike are not only [talking about the problem](http://www.governing.com/news/headlines/cities-can-promote-innovation-procurement.html) but [tackling the issue head on](http://www.codeforamerica.org/governments/capabilities/procurement/). 

I saw the need for changes to procurement when I managed the contracts with CfA’s partner governments for the 2011 and 2012 Fellowships. The process was grueling for all parties involved. The Fellowship didn’t fit general procurement templates where X number of hours had to result in X deliverables and products. So we spent countless hours back and forth finding ways to contract with government. At the end, we joked that the first stage of CfA’s government disruption actually began when we finally got the contracts signed, months before any of the fellows joined. CfA’s first government contracts were small victories that foreshadowed the challenges civic entrepreneurs face when trying to sell to government. 

Now, at this year’s Summit, procurement took the main stage &#8212; another small victory. Nashville’s Co-Chief Innovation Director Yiaway Yeh described a [multi-city innovation program](http://www.codeforamerica.org/projects/nashville-boston-raleigh-palo-alto-multi-city-innovation-campaign/) aimed at reducing the procurement barriers for entrepreneurs wanting to do business with government. The City of Oakland’s Kiran Jain shared how the [Digital Front Door](http://www.codeforamerica.org/our-work/initiatives/digitalfrontdoor/) project experimented with streamlining the procurement process to better enable local businesses to compete for technology and creative service contracts. And one of the 2015 Fellowship cities, Pittsburgh, will work on procurement over the course of next year &#8212; surely making for some additional main stage content next year. 

At [Omidyar Network](http://www.omidyar.com), we consider these small victories to be big wins for civic tech. I’s important to foster an [ecosystem of viable and sustainable civic tech companies](http://www.ssireview.org/blog/entry/fostering_for_profit_civic_innovation), and that requires pathways for civic tech to enter the government market. Improving the demand side of the procurement process is essential but it cannot be successful without a similar effort on the supply side. The [government transparency initiative](http://www.omidyar.com/initiatives/government-transparency) at Omidyar Network works with civic tech companies to manage the challenges they face selling to government customers as they mature into viable companies. These challenges are different from those faced by government; however we’re optimistic that the small victories in the demand side of procurement will advance the supply side toward creation of a sustainable civic tech ecosystem.
