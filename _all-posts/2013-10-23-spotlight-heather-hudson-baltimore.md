Heather Hudson is the [recently-appointed](http://www.govtech.com/policy-management/Baltimore-Fills-New-Chief-Data-Officer-Role.html) Chief Data Officer for the City of Baltimore. Though Baltimore has long been recognized as a leader in data-driven decision making, having [pioneered](http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2010-06-30/news/bs-ed-citistat-20100630_1_citistat-innovators-city-trash-and-recycling) the [Baltimore CitiStat](http://www.baltimorecity.gov/Government/AgenciesDepartments/CitiStat.aspx) performance management program, the role of Chief Data Officer is new to the Mayor&#8217;s Office of Information Technology. In this new role, Heather is leading the effort to update and streamline the City&#8217;s open data initiative, [OpenBaltimore](https://data.baltimorecity.gov/), and the existing CitiStat program, as well implementing big data and predictive analytics processes to allow for more efficient and robust data analysis.

Hudson [spoke at the Code for America Summit](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7Ec7S7hUGE) last week about the evolution of Baltimore&#8217;s approach towards open data — and how her own ideas of the role of open data in cities have changed since working on the City&#8217;s OpenBaltimore initiative.

OpenBaltimore launched in early 2011, which was fairly early in the game compared to other cities, Hudson explained. The main focus of the initiative initially was transparency, citing a quote from Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake [on the initial goals of the initiative](http://www.baltimorecity.gov/OfficeoftheMayor/NewsMedia/tabid/66/ID/883/Mayor_Rawlings-Blake_Signs_Executive_Order_Creating_Open_Data_Initiative_for_City_Government.aspx): &#8220;Providing public access to government data will increase transparency and improve the level of trust between the people and their government.&#8221;

&#8220;I was hired in June of 2011 to just do open data. I came in and I was so excited about transparency. I thought it would be easy to just get the data online,&#8221; Hudson said. But her perspective quickly shifted. One of the very first datasets Baltimore released was parking citations. Right after Hudson started in June, a local developer built an app called [SpotAgent](http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2011-03-14/business/bs-bz-balttech-spotagent-city-data-20110314_1_web-application-city-data-red-light-camera-ticket): a simple smartphone app that analyzed the City&#8217;s parking citation data to reliably predict a user&#8217;s chances of getting a ticket at a particular location, date, and time.

When Hudson went to the next CitiStat meeting where the app was discussed, one of the deputy mayors pointed out that parking citations shouldn&#8217;t be so predictable in the first place. The parking authority was asked to start randomizing the days, times, and locations of the parking enforcement officers&#8217; schedules.

&#8220;That was the moment I realized open data is not just about transparency — it can teach us how to run the City&#8217;s operations better,&#8221; said Hudson. In the hands of citizens who are looking at it from a different perspective, data can reveal new insights about how the City is running and where there is room for improvement.

> &#8220;Open data not only improves transparency and invites community participation. Open data also improves interagency collaboration and government efficiency.&#8221;
