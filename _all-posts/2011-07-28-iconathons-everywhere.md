The [Iconathon](http://iconathon.org) events are catching on. Since we launched the [Iconathon](http://iconathon.org) project two weeks ago, we have had overwhelming support from the design &#038; UX communities and many amazing people in cities across the country.

We are excited to announce 4 confirmed events in [cities](http://iconathon.org/cities/) across the country (with more in the works.) 

### Cities

  * August 13: **Los Angeles.** Theme: _Food &#038; Nutrition_
  * August 20: **Chicago.** Theme: _Democracy_

Please visit the <a href="[Iconathon Event page](http://iconathon.org/cities/) for more information on the registration, speakers &#038; workshops, themes, concepts, process, icon requirements &#038; partnering organizations.

### Other cities in the works

We are still solidifying these cities. If you are from these cities and want to help us, tell us and we will connect you to the local organizers.

### What are the Iconathons?

Code for America, in partnership with the [Noun Project](http://thenounproject.com) is organizing a new initiative to create civic symbols for the public domain, at day-long design events called &#8220;Iconathons.&#8221; Through facilitated design sessions, participants will generate icons and symbols that visually convey concepts frequently needed in civic design. The aim of Iconathon is to add to the public domain a set of graphic symbols that can be used by both the public and the private sectors to easily communicate universally recognized concepts to city inhabitants.
