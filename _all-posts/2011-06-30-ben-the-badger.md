The back story:

<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7209" title="Badger vs. Abhi" src="http://codeforamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/badgerVSabhi.jpg" alt="" />In February, CfA Fellows gathered to discuss the branding of the organization, mostly just to orient ourselves to it. One of the ways I like to do this with any brand is to do a word association exercise. I like to start by writing down obvious words (government, technology, etc.) then move to related words, then finally abstract. In the abstract section I asked &#8220;what kind of animal would represent Code for America&#8221;? (Note: Youtube user czg123&#8242;s (aka Randall) had <a title="Randall's Honey Badger Video" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4r7wHMg5Yjg" target="_blank">his vote</a> well documented already [NSFW].)

Badger was a crowd favorite (along with rabbit and panda to name a few). Over the last few months this discussion has become a bit of a hot topic among fellows and staff. [Alan Palazzolo](http://codeforamerica.org/author/alan/ "Alan Palazzolo") has even created a <a title="Badger vs. Panda" href="http://badgerpanda.codeforamerica.org" target="_blank">Badger vs. Panda voting system</a> to help highlight the overwhelming popularity of the badger mentality (eat cobras, take naps, &#8220;don&#8217;t give a&#8230;&#8221;) but was actually a study on online voting systems.

In conjunction with Alan&#8217;s app, I undertook a project to sculpt a 5&#8243; Ben the Badger figurine that would finally put the debate to rest. Here&#8217;s what I have so far&#8230;

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7210" title="ben-full-half" src="http://codeforamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/ben-full-half.jpg" alt="" /><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7211" title="ben-hind-quarter" src="http://codeforamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/ben-hind-quarter.jpg" alt="" /><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7212" title="ben-face-detail" src="http://codeforamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/ben-face-detail.jpg" alt="" />I will be doing a 3D scan of the model and then making a digital version (both left and right sides). We can then use a hi-res 3D printer to produce a master and then mold and produce replicas. I hope they are affordable enough so we can give them as a gift to our friends in the cities and as a token to remember our fellowship by.
