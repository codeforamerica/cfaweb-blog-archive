In 48 communities around the world neighbors came together for [CodeAcross 2014](http://www.codeforamerica.org/events/codeacross-2014/) (Feb. 21-23, 2014). During these 72 hours,  50+ event organizers and 2,500+ participants worked together to make a difference in the communities where they live and work.

To everyone who participated in CodeAcross, thank you. These are your accomplishments.

**Stories and Press**
  
To more deeply understand the impact of CodeAcross, we looked to organizers, participants,  and press outlets for stories of what happened at each of the local events. And we didn&#8217;t have to look far.

Over CodeAcross weekend, the #codeacross activity on Twitter and Tumblr painted a vivid picture of the energy and accomplishments from the weekend. Check out [this Storify](http://www.codeforamerica.org/blog/2014/02/25/thanks-for-codingacross-the-world/) for a summary of #codeacross.

Event organizers were also excited to share their stories:

  * [Miami, FL](http://codeformiami.org/OpenDataJam/): “At Miami Open Data Jam, we brainstormed and mapped ideas for an open data policy and prioritizing open data in Miami-Dade County. Developers, journalists, activists, local elected officials, county staff, and a few open data experts showed up to think about these issues and work together on a roadmap for action.”
  * [Grand Rapids, MI](http://codeacrossgr.org/): &#8220;On Friday, the space was filled to capacity with around 75 people, including the city comptroller, a city commissioner, and the City&#8217;s director of IT&#8230;Jonathan Pichot&#8230; unveiled Grand Rapids Open Data, a City-supported community-powered data portal.”
  * [St. Louis, MO](http://www.eventbrite.com/e/code-across-2014-meetup-tickets-10663742541): &#8220;And we made some real progress on our data census for the City of St Louis, giving us some key information to bring back to city government!”

And there was an abundance of local coverage. Check out the press, blogs, and recaps from CodeAcross events around the world.

Over CodeAcross weekend, the #codeacross activity on Twitter and Tumblr painted a vivid picture of the energy and accomplishments from the weekend. Check out [this Storify](http://www.codeforamerica.org/blog/2014/02/25/thanks-for-codingacross-the-world/) for a summary of #codeacross.

Event organizers were also excited to share their stories:

  * [Miami, FL](http://codeformiami.org/OpenDataJam/): “At Miami Open Data Jam, we brainstormed and mapped ideas for an open data policy and prioritizing open data in Miami-Dade County. Developers, journalists, activists, local elected officials, county staff, and a few open data experts showed up to think about these issues and work together on a roadmap for action.”
  * [Grand Rapids, MI](http://codeacrossgr.org/): &#8220;On Friday, the space was filled to capacity with around 75 people, including the city comptroller, a city commissioner, and the City&#8217;s director of IT&#8230;Jonathan Pichot&#8230; unveiled Grand Rapids Open Data, a City-supported community-powered data portal.”
  * [St. Louis, MO](http://www.eventbrite.com/e/code-across-2014-meetup-tickets-10663742541): &#8220;And we made some real progress on our data census for the City of St Louis, giving us some key information to bring back to city government!”

And there was an abundance of local coverage. Check out the press, blogs, and recaps from CodeAcross events around the world.

  * [Grand Rapids, MI](http://codeacrossgr.org/): &#8220;On Friday, the space was filled to capacity with around 75 people, including the city comptroller, a city commissioner, and the City&#8217;s director of IT&#8230;Jonathan Pichot&#8230; unveiled Grand Rapids Open Data, a City-supported community-powered data portal.”

  * In 2014, we over doubled the number of CodeAcross events from 2013 &#8212; from 22 in 2013 to 48 in 2014.

**Stories and Press**
  
To more deeply understand the impact of CodeAcross, we looked to organizers, participants,  and press outlets for stories of what happened at each of the local events. And we didn&#8217;t have to look far.

Over CodeAcross weekend, the #codeacross activity on Twitter and Tumblr painted a vivid picture of the energy and accomplishments from the weekend. Check out [this Storify](http://www.codeforamerica.org/blog/2014/02/25/thanks-for-codingacross-the-world/) for a summary of #codeacross.

Event organizers were also excited to share their stories:

  * [Miami, FL](http://codeformiami.org/OpenDataJam/): “At Miami Open Data Jam, we brainstormed and mapped ideas for an open data policy and prioritizing open data in Miami-Dade County. Developers, journalists, activists, local elected officials, county staff, and a few open data experts showed up to think about these issues and work together on a roadmap for action.”
  * [Grand Rapids, MI](http://codeacrossgr.org/): &#8220;On Friday, the space was filled to capacity with around 75 people, including the city comptroller, a city commissioner, and the City&#8217;s director of IT&#8230;Jonathan Pichot&#8230; unveiled Grand Rapids Open Data, a City-supported community-powered data portal.”
  * [St. Louis, MO](http://www.eventbrite.com/e/code-across-2014-meetup-tickets-10663742541): &#8220;And we made some real progress on our data census for the City of St Louis, giving us some key information to bring back to city government!”

And there was an abundance of local coverage. Check out the press, blogs, and recaps from CodeAcross events around the world.

Event organizers were also excited to share their stories:

  * [Miami, FL](http://codeformiami.org/OpenDataJam/): “At Miami Open Data Jam, we brainstormed and mapped ideas for an open data policy and prioritizing open data in Miami-Dade County. Developers, journalists, activists, local elected officials, county staff, and a few open data experts showed up to think about these issues and work together on a roadmap for action.”
  * [Grand Rapids, MI](http://codeacrossgr.org/): &#8220;On Friday, the space was filled to capacity with around 75 people, including the city comptroller, a city commissioner, and the City&#8217;s director of IT&#8230;Jonathan Pichot&#8230; unveiled Grand Rapids Open Data, a City-supported community-powered data portal.”
  * [St. Louis, MO](http://www.eventbrite.com/e/code-across-2014-meetup-tickets-10663742541): &#8220;And we made some real progress on our data census for the City of St Louis, giving us some key information to bring back to city government!”

And there was an abundance of local coverage. Check out the press, blogs, and recaps from CodeAcross events around the world.

Event organizers were also excited to share their stories:

  * [Miami, FL](http://codeformiami.org/OpenDataJam/): “At Miami Open Data Jam, we brainstormed and mapped ideas for an open data policy and prioritizing open data in Miami-Dade County. Developers, journalists, activists, local elected officials, county staff, and a few open data experts showed up to think about these issues and work together on a roadmap for action.”
  * [Grand Rapids, MI](http://codeacrossgr.org/): &#8220;On Friday, the space was filled to capacity with around 75 people, including the city comptroller, a city commissioner, and the City&#8217;s director of IT&#8230;Jonathan Pichot&#8230; unveiled Grand Rapids Open Data, a City-supported community-powered data portal.”
  * [St. Louis, MO](http://www.eventbrite.com/e/code-across-2014-meetup-tickets-10663742541): &#8220;And we made some real progress on our data census for the City of St Louis, giving us some key information to bring back to city government!”

And there was an abundance of local coverage. Check out the press, blogs, and recaps from CodeAcross events around the world.

Over CodeAcross weekend, the #codeacross activity on Twitter and Tumblr painted a vivid picture of the energy and accomplishments from the weekend. Check out [this Storify](http://www.codeforamerica.org/blog/2014/02/25/thanks-for-codingacross-the-world/) for a summary of #codeacross.

Event organizers were also excited to share their stories:

  * [Miami, FL](http://codeformiami.org/OpenDataJam/): “At Miami Open Data Jam, we brainstormed and mapped ideas for an open data policy and prioritizing open data in Miami-Dade County. Developers, journalists, activists, local elected officials, county staff, and a few open data experts showed up to think about these issues and work together on a roadmap for action.”
  * [Grand Rapids, MI](http://codeacrossgr.org/): &#8220;On Friday, the space was filled to capacity with around 75 people, including the city comptroller, a city commissioner, and the City&#8217;s director of IT&#8230;Jonathan Pichot&#8230; unveiled Grand Rapids Open Data, a City-supported community-powered data portal.”
  * [St. Louis, MO](http://www.eventbrite.com/e/code-across-2014-meetup-tickets-10663742541): &#8220;And we made some real progress on our data census for the City of St Louis, giving us some key information to bring back to city government!”

And there was an abundance of local coverage. Check out the press, blogs, and recaps from CodeAcross events around the world.

In 48 communities around the world neighbors came together for [CodeAcross 2014](http://www.codeforamerica.org/events/codeacross-2014/) (Feb. 21-23, 2014). During these 72 hours,  50+ event organizers and 2,500+ participants worked together to make a difference in the communities where they live and work.

To everyone who participated in CodeAcross, thank you. These are your accomplishments.

**Stories and Press**
  
To more deeply understand the impact of CodeAcross, we looked to organizers, participants,  and press outlets for stories of what happened at each of the local events. And we didn&#8217;t have to look far.

Over CodeAcross weekend, the #codeacross activity on Twitter and Tumblr painted a vivid picture of the energy and accomplishments from the weekend. Check out [this Storify](http://www.codeforamerica.org/blog/2014/02/25/thanks-for-codingacross-the-world/) for a summary of #codeacross.

Event organizers were also excited to share their stories:

  * [Miami, FL](http://codeformiami.org/OpenDataJam/): “At Miami Open Data Jam, we brainstormed and mapped ideas for an open data policy and prioritizing open data in Miami-Dade County. Developers, journalists, activists, local elected officials, county staff, and a few open data experts showed up to think about these issues and work together on a roadmap for action.”
  * [Grand Rapids, MI](http://codeacrossgr.org/): &#8220;On Friday, the space was filled to capacity with around 75 people, including the city comptroller, a city commissioner, and the City&#8217;s director of IT&#8230;Jonathan Pichot&#8230; unveiled Grand Rapids Open Data, a City-supported community-powered data portal.”
  * [St. Louis, MO](http://www.eventbrite.com/e/code-across-2014-meetup-tickets-10663742541): &#8220;And we made some real progress on our data census for the City of St Louis, giving us some key information to bring back to city government!”

And there was an abundance of local coverage. Check out the press, blogs, and recaps from CodeAcross events around the world.

Event organizers were also excited to share their stories:

  * [Miami, FL](http://codeformiami.org/OpenDataJam/): “At Miami Open Data Jam, we brainstormed and mapped ideas for an open data policy and prioritizing open data in Miami-Dade County. Developers, journalists, activists, local elected officials, county staff, and a few open data experts showed up to think about these issues and work together on a roadmap for action.”
  * [Grand Rapids, MI](http://codeacrossgr.org/): &#8220;On Friday, the space was filled to capacity with around 75 people, including the city comptroller, a city commissioner, and the City&#8217;s director of IT&#8230;Jonathan Pichot&#8230; unveiled Grand Rapids Open Data, a City-supported community-powered data portal.”
  * [St. Louis, MO](http://www.eventbrite.com/e/code-across-2014-meetup-tickets-10663742541): &#8220;And we made some real progress on our data census for the City of St Louis, giving us some key information to bring back to city government!”

And there was an abundance of local coverage. Check out the press, blogs, and recaps from CodeAcross events around the world.

Developers, journalists, activists, local elected officials, county staff, and a few open data experts showed up to think about these issues and work together on a roadmap for action.”
  * [Grand Rapids, MI](http://codeacrossgr.org/): &#8220;On Friday, the space was filled to capacity with around 75 people, including the city comptroller, a city commissioner, and the City&#8217;s director of IT&#8230;Jonathan Pichot&#8230; unveiled Grand Rapids Open Data, a City-supported community-powered data portal.”

**Stories and Press**
  
To more deeply understand the impact of CodeAcross, we looked to organizers, participants,  and press outlets for stories of what happened at each of the local events. And we didn&#8217;t have to look far.

Over CodeAcross weekend, the #codeacross activity on Twitter and Tumblr painted a vivid picture of the energy and accomplishments from the weekend. Check out [this Storify](http://www.codeforamerica.org/blog/2014/02/25/thanks-for-codingacross-the-world/) for a summary of #codeacross.

Event organizers were also excited to share their stories:

  * [Miami, FL](http://codeformiami.org/OpenDataJam/): “At Miami Open Data Jam, we brainstormed and mapped ideas for an open data policy and prioritizing open data in Miami-Dade County. Developers, journalists, activists, local elected officials, county staff, and a few open data experts showed up to think about these issues and work together on a roadmap for action.”
  * [Grand Rapids, MI](http://codeacrossgr.org/): &#8220;On Friday, the space was filled to capacity with around 75 people, including the city comptroller, a city commissioner, and the City&#8217;s director of IT&#8230;Jonathan Pichot&#8230; unveiled Grand Rapids Open Data, a City-supported community-powered data portal.”
  * [St. Louis, MO](http://www.eventbrite.com/e/code-across-2014-meetup-tickets-10663742541): &#8220;And we made some real progress on our data census for the City of St Louis, giving us some key information to bring back to city government!”

And there was an abundance of local coverage. Check out the press, blogs, and recaps from CodeAcross events around the world.

In 48 communities around the world neighbors came together for [CodeAcross 2014](http://www.codeforamerica.org/events/codeacross-2014/) (Feb. 21-23, 2014). During these 72 hours,  50+ event organizers and 2,500+ participants worked together to make a difference in the communities where they live and work.

To everyone who participated in CodeAcross, thank you. These are your accomplishments.

**Stories and Press**
  
To more deeply understand the impact of CodeAcross, we looked to organizers, participants,  and press outlets for stories of what happened at each of the local events. And we didn&#8217;t have to look far.

Over CodeAcross weekend, the #codeacross activity on Twitter and Tumblr painted a vivid picture of the energy and accomplishments from the weekend. Check out [this Storify](http://www.codeforamerica.org/blog/2014/02/25/thanks-for-codingacross-the-world/) for a summary of #codeacross.

Event organizers were also excited to share their stories:

  * [Miami, FL](http://codeformiami.org/OpenDataJam/): “At Miami Open Data Jam, we brainstormed and mapped ideas for an open data policy and prioritizing open data in Miami-Dade County. Developers, journalists, activists, local elected officials, county staff, and a few open data experts showed up to think about these issues and work together on a roadmap for action.”
  * [Grand Rapids, MI](http://codeacrossgr.org/): &#8220;On Friday, the space was filled to capacity with around 75 people, including the city comptroller, a city commissioner, and the City&#8217;s director of IT&#8230;Jonathan Pichot&#8230; unveiled Grand Rapids Open Data, a City-supported community-powered data portal.”
  * [St. Louis, MO](http://www.eventbrite.com/e/code-across-2014-meetup-tickets-10663742541): &#8220;And we made some real progress on our data census for the City of St Louis, giving us some key information to bring back to city government!”

And there was an abundance of local coverage. Check out the press, blogs, and recaps from CodeAcross events around the world.

To more deeply understand the impact of CodeAcross, we looked to organizers, participants,  and press outlets for stories of what happened at each of the local events. And we didn&#8217;t have to look far.

Over CodeAcross weekend, the #codeacross activity on Twitter and Tumblr painted a vivid picture of the energy and accomplishments from the weekend. Check out [this Storify](http://www.codeforamerica.org/blog/2014/02/25/thanks-for-codingacross-the-world/) for a summary of #codeacross.

Event organizers were also excited to share their stories:

  * [Miami, FL](http://codeformiami.org/OpenDataJam/): “At Miami Open Data Jam, we brainstormed and mapped ideas for an open data policy and prioritizing open data in Miami-Dade County. Developers, journalists, activists, local elected officials, county staff, and a few open data experts showed up to think about these issues and work together on a roadmap for action.”
  * [Grand Rapids, MI](http://codeacrossgr.org/): &#8220;On Friday, the space was filled to capacity with around 75 people, including the city comptroller, a city commissioner, and the City&#8217;s director of IT&#8230;Jonathan Pichot&#8230; unveiled Grand Rapids Open Data, a City-supported community-powered data portal.”
  * [St. Louis, MO](http://www.eventbrite.com/e/code-across-2014-meetup-tickets-10663742541): &#8220;And we made some real progress on our data census for the City of St Louis, giving us some key information to bring back to city government!”

And there was an abundance of local coverage. Check out the press, blogs, and recaps from CodeAcross events around the world.

Over CodeAcross weekend, the #codeacross activity on Twitter and Tumblr painted a vivid picture of the energy and accomplishments from the weekend. Check out [this Storify](http://www.codeforamerica.org/blog/2014/02/25/thanks-for-codingacross-the-world/) for a summary of #codeacross.

Event organizers were also excited to share their stories:

  * [Miami, FL](http://codeformiami.org/OpenDataJam/): “At Miami Open Data Jam, we brainstormed and mapped ideas for an open data policy and prioritizing open data in Miami-Dade County. Developers, journalists, activists, local elected officials, county staff, and a few open data experts showed up to think about these issues and work together on a roadmap for action.”
  * [Grand Rapids, MI](http://codeacrossgr.org/): &#8220;On Friday, the space was filled to capacity with around 75 people, including the city comptroller, a city commissioner, and the City&#8217;s director of IT&#8230;Jonathan Pichot&#8230; unveiled Grand Rapids Open Data, a City-supported community-powered data portal.”
  * [St. Louis, MO](http://www.eventbrite.com/e/code-across-2014-meetup-tickets-10663742541): &#8220;And we made some real progress on our data census for the City of St Louis, giving us some key information to bring back to city government!”

And there was an abundance of local coverage. Check out the press, blogs, and recaps from CodeAcross events around the world.

Event organizers were also excited to share their stories:

  * [Miami, FL](http://codeformiami.org/OpenDataJam/): “At Miami Open Data Jam, we brainstormed and mapped ideas for an open data policy and prioritizing open data in Miami-Dade County. Developers, journalists, activists, local elected officials, county staff, and a few open data experts showed up to think about these issues and work together on a roadmap for action.”
  * [Grand Rapids, MI](http://codeacrossgr.org/): &#8220;On Friday, the space was filled to capacity with around 75 people, including the city comptroller, a city commissioner, and the City&#8217;s director of IT&#8230;Jonathan Pichot&#8230; unveiled Grand Rapids Open Data, a City-supported community-powered data portal.”

Over CodeAcross weekend, the #codeacross activity on Twitter and Tumblr painted a vivid picture of the energy and accomplishments from the weekend. Check out [this Storify](http://www.codeforamerica.org/blog/2014/02/25/thanks-for-codingacross-the-world/) for a summary of #codeacross.

Event organizers were also excited to share their stories:

  * [Miami, FL](http://codeformiami.org/OpenDataJam/): “At Miami Open Data Jam, we brainstormed and mapped ideas for an open data policy and prioritizing open data in Miami-Dade County. Developers, journalists, activists, local elected officials, county staff, and a few open data experts showed up to think about these issues and work together on a roadmap for action.”
  * [Grand Rapids, MI](http://codeacrossgr.org/): &#8220;On Friday, the space was filled to capacity with around 75 people, including the city comptroller, a city commissioner, and the City&#8217;s director of IT&#8230;Jonathan Pichot&#8230; unveiled Grand Rapids Open Data, a City-supported community-powered data portal.”
  * [St. Louis, MO](http://www.eventbrite.com/e/code-across-2014-meetup-tickets-10663742541): &#8220;And we made some real progress on our data census for the City of St Louis, giving us some key information to bring back to city government!”

**2013 vs. 2014**

  * In 2014, we over doubled the number of CodeAcross events from 2013 &#8212; from 22 in 2013 to 48 in 2014.

**Stories and Press**
  
To more deeply understand the impact of CodeAcross, we looked to organizers, participants,  and press outlets for stories of what happened at each of the local events. And we didn&#8217;t have to look far.

Over CodeAcross weekend, the #codeacross activity on Twitter and Tumblr painted a vivid picture of the energy and accomplishments from the weekend. Check out [this Storify](http://www.codeforamerica.org/blog/2014/02/25/thanks-for-codingacross-the-world/) for a summary of #codeacross.

Event organizers were also excited to share their stories:

  * [Miami, FL](http://codeformiami.org/OpenDataJam/): “At Miami Open Data Jam, we brainstormed and mapped ideas for an open data policy and prioritizing open data in Miami-Dade County. Developers, journalists, activists, local elected officials, county staff, and a few open data experts showed up to think about these issues and work together on a roadmap for action.”
  * [Grand Rapids, MI](http://codeacrossgr.org/): &#8220;On Friday, the space was filled to capacity with around 75 people, including the city comptroller, a city commissioner, and the City&#8217;s director of IT&#8230;Jonathan Pichot&#8230; unveiled Grand Rapids Open Data, a City-supported community-powered data portal.”
  * [St. Louis, MO](http://www.eventbrite.com/e/code-across-2014-meetup-tickets-10663742541): &#8220;And we made some real progress on our data census for the City of St Louis, giving us some key information to bring back to city government!”

And there was an abundance of local coverage. Check out the press, blogs, and recaps from CodeAcross events around the world.

**Key Learnings and Next Steps**
  
We asked CodeAcross event organizers to give their CodeAcross experience a letter grade: 76 percent of event organizers gave it an A; 17 percent gave it a B; and 7 percent gave it a C.

The requests for improvement generally fell into three categories: more lead time and notice for CodeAcross; more templates and tools available earlier on; and more flexibility with the dates.

Next up the Brigade is to help track and sustain the momentum out of CodeAcross. A few ways we&#8217;ll be doing this is by helping new Brigades continue to grow, inviting CodeAcross participants into the Brigade network, and tracking CodeAcross projects.

Oh, yeah. And we&#8217;ll also be applying the lessons we learned from CodeAcross to National Day of Civic Hacking this June. Y&#8217;all ready to do this again? We are!
