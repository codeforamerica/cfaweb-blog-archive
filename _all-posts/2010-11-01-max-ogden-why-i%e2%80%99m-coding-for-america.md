Since I&#8217;m a nerd, work tends to take up most of my day. Based on that,  I want to make sure that what I work on is something that I truly think is making a positive impact. While I appreciate the experience that working at a startup has given me, I would much rather be building what I love.

I am morally aligned with CfA, and these ideas are more important to me than a developer salary or stock options. Creating a positive force in a government abound in negativity is something that I will always be able to be proud of.
