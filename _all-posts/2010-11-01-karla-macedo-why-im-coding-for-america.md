My dream job is this. A chance to work for something greater than myself. A chance to really work on something worthwhile and meaningful, something that will benefit more than a few shareholders. I want to work in a team environment where we all strive for the same goals of success, all while still potentially making a difference in other peoples lives.

As a bilingual young Latin American, I understand the importance of working together to make a difference for our whole community. My mother runs a Licensed Day Care, which works with many parents including those in subsidized and state-run programs.

I have seen first hand the importance of a strong government can do. I believe strongly in the ability to make a change through a common link of knowledge, and what better way to do so than by leveraging today&#8217;s most widely-used technologies.
