<p dir="ltr">
  From an early age I had a desire to observe and understand other people’s way of living and to comprehend their world. As a teenager I decided to study anthropology at the University of Buenos Aires where I was introduced to the world of ethnographic research. My professional career began at one of the world’s largest consumer-focused companies where I worked to inform marketing efforts to predict and shape consumer habits.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  While working in consumer research I observed my colleagues cite the need to conduct a greater quantity of higher quality research. However something was amiss. Despite the fulfillment of their wishes via million-dollar research budgets, the team continually missed their target because they never took the time to aim at real problems. The investment was not made to get in touch and become intimate with the customer and their needs. To see the world from their perspective. To travel through the ups and downs of their lives. To share the pains and pleasures as a careful observer might.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  We were in positions of great power, creating products that harnessed new behaviors of millions of people. During this time I began to think more critically about habits in the lives of consumer and how they can be harmful or healthy. I think this power comes with the responsibility to behave in an ethical way when conducting research. This led me to ultimately leave the company to seek deeper meaning in the world of non-profits.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  Happiness seemed to come in my DNA, but meaning has proven more elusive. Ethnography with a dose of curiosity is where I find my meaning today. Within the tech world, ethnography offers useful tools to uncover present insights and develop future scenarios.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  Code for America presented me with an opportunity to change my behavior and create a new habit for my daily life. A habit full of meaning and responsibility. A challenge to reclaim more agency, power and knowledge and ensure the outcomes resonate with the people I am responsible to. In Kathy Sierra&#8217;s words: “we have to look at what makes those users successful.”
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  I believe in the power of Code for America as an experiment that allows for feedback loops and learning. As an experiment that acts as a lens for new opportunities and helps expose people in government to new possibilities. Code for America reminds us that institutions and systems are social constructions that can be organized differently, that the future is unwritten.

Working with the best and inspired by the top creative minds, I am proud to become a member of this group, the [Code for America Fellows.](http://www.codeforamerica.org/about/fellowship/)
