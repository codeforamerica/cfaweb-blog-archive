[<img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3775" title="love" src="http://codeforamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/love-300x198.jpg" alt="" />](http://codeforamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/love.jpg)The woman on the phone didn’t want to complain, and she didn’t need help getting her car dug out of the snow. She just wanted to know if the geese she saw in the park were going to be OK.

In the 311 operations room in the middle of Philadelphia, an operator thought for a second, and told the woman to ask a local game official. She patched her through to the wild animal line, and told her to talk to them about whether this unusual patch of cold would affect the geese. After she thanked him and hung up, he entered her information into the system, and then took another call.

Maybe you don’t care about geese (I don’t: geese bite toes). But you should care about the interaction itself, because it illustrates how 311 is changing the model for how citizens interact with their city governments. And like any good relationship, 311 is all about honest, two-way communication.

311 started off in nearby Baltimore in the 1980s as a way to divert non-emergency calls away from 911 lines, where goose issues were taxing the ability of dispatches to summon first responders to actual crises. Over time, 311 changed from being only about asking for the government to do things, to asking the government how to do things. Suddenly people realized that there was an ear to talk to. And maybe, the people began to feel a little more that the city cared. Maybe even loved them.

Today, the majority of 311 calls in major cities revolve around information requests. In Philly, some 80% of 311 calls involve a citizen requesting information, with only 20% being requests for services. This signals that citizens are increasingly thinking of 311 as the place to ask questions, and to get answers. Since [its 2008 launch](http://www.pewtrusts.org/news_room_detail.aspx?id=57568), Philadelaphia&#8217;s Philly311 has not only taken on growing volume but done so increasingly effectively and efficiently. And that&#8217;s important, because 311 talk isn’t exactly cheap. The average call to Philly’s 311 costs the city $2.20; pricey, but well below the $3.39 median price for a 311 call to 15 other comparable large cities. This means that while Philadelaphia is setting an example for an streamlined 311, there&#8217;s value in getting useful civic information online and more readily accessible at lower or no costs. That&#8217;s part of [what we&#8217;ll be working](http://codeforamerica.org/philadelphia) on with the city this year.

Why? Because when citizens feel they can actually get information from their government, beautiful things happens. To quote the less touchy language of a recent [study](http://www.innovations.harvard.edu/cache/documents/1285/128521.pdf) from Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government: “311 holds the prospect for deepening citizen engagement with government&#8230; in ways perhaps unthinkable” before its advent. All of a sudden, government isn’t just something that tickets your car, or changes zoning ordinances, but is a source of information, an asset. Someone to talk to. Even if its only about some geese in the snow.
