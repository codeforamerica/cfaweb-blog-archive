I had a chance to attend the 2011 Esri Developer Summit with another Code for America Fellow <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/author/aaron/" target="_blank">Aaron Ogle</a> in Palm Springs, CA last week. The Esri Developer Summit is a chance for programmers to learn more about how to build applications on the Esri platform, see the Esri product road map, meet the teams behind the products and a chance to network with other developers. While at the Developer Summit, Aaron and I dove into all these aspects of the platform. Plus, the Developer Summit is on a much smaller scale than the Annual User Conference, so developers can really focus in on technical sessions and the events really get engaged with the developer community.

On the first night of the conference, Esri and Microsoft sponsored the &#8220;Light Up the Night Challenge&#8221;. This was Esri&#8217;s first ever on site coding contest, basically a mini hack-a-thon. Developers had 3 hours to build an application based off different criteria using Esri sample data sets using the Esri Silverlight API. Having never developed a single line of code in Silverlight but having a background in the Esri .NET Web ADF, I decided to give the contest a shot.

During the 3 hours I basically learned as much as I could about the Esri Silverlight API and built an application. The application used the Esri sample data for San Francisco 311 data and overlayed the data on a map. In the application you can search by address and click on the icons to learn more about the incident. (A [live demo is available](http://esridevsummit.apphb.com/default.aspx) if you&#8217;d like to try it out.) The code from that night is available on a github.com repo <a href="https://github.com/ryanatwork/DevSummitAGSilverLight" target="_blank">here</a>, and you can check out the great apps other people created <a href="http://www.esri.com/events/devsummit/get-involved/lightup-challenge.html" target="_blank">here</a>.

On the second day of the conference the plenary session took place as well as several other technical sessions throughout the day. Tim O&#8217;Reilly had a chance to speak about [&#8220;Government as a Platform&#8221;](http://opengovernment.labs.oreilly.com/) to the audience at the Esri Summit. Tim also discussed working on different items related to GIS and mapping.  One thing that really resonated during this is when Tim said, &#8220;Work on stuff that matters.&#8221;  Also he gave a great pitch about Code for America during this session.

In the afternoon the Code for America Local Government Applications track took place. One of the highlights of the Developer Summit for me was being able to talk about Code for America and our city projects with  Jennifer Palka, Tim O&#8217;Reilly, and Aaron Ogle in front of an audience of GIS developers. The great response that we received from both the audience and Esri staff for our presentation was amazing.

The final session in the track had our friends from Stamen Design and Azavea in Philadelphia. Stamen displayed much of the work that they are doing and parts of the process they went through for Oakland Crimespotting. Robert Cheetham, President and Founder of Azavea showed off many of the applications that they were working on in Philadelphia. One application is [PhillyHistory.org](http://www.azavea.com/clients/phillyhistory/) which shows locations of historical photos in Philadelphia.  He also mentioned the great work our Code for America Philadelphia team is doing a number of times in his presentation.

One of the cool things we saw at Esri was the use of a Microsoft Kinect to control a map. With the Kinect, the map can be controlled with arm movements and allowed you to zoom and pan. Also there were a few annotation features available. It was a pretty fun and interesting way to experience a map &#8212; just ask Jen (see left).

Overall the Esri Developer summit was a great experience. It was awesome to see how Esri products are developing like the ArcGIS Javascript API and the ArcGIS Mobile platform to get more developers engaged in geospatial app development, and the developers in attendance were both interested and supportive of the work that we are doing at Code for America. I left the conference feeling like there was a strong and growing community of people looking forward to working together to make maps and technology for the common good.
