The fourth annual <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/summit" target="_blank">Code for America Summit</a> kicks off in San Francisco on September 23 &#8212; just a few weeks away. Will you be there?

The Summit is _the_ place for civic change agents to exchange ideas, explore solutions, and identify best practices to help governments work better.

And this year will be the biggest yet, with attendees ranging from mayors to entrepreneurs, community organizers to government CTOs from more than 120 government agencies. Key themes we’ll be exploring throughout the <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/summit/schedule/" target="_blank">three day schedule</a> include what happens when cities:

  * design for and with people
  * default to open
  * use data for better decisions
  * work with their community
  * organize for innovation

Featured speakers _not to be missed_ include:

  * **Mikey Dickerson**, Healthcare.gov
  * **Susan Crawford**, John A. Reilly Visiting Professor in Intellectual Property at the Harvard Law School & former Special Assistant for Science, Technology and Innovation Policy at the White House
  * **John Lilly**, Partner, Greylock & former CEO, Mozilla
  * **Michael Flowers**, former Chief Analytics Officer, New York City
  * **Yiaway Yeh**, Co-Chief Innovation Officer, Nashville & former Mayor, Palo Alto
  * **Aldona Valicenti**, Chief Information Office, City of Lexington

Beyond the excitement of the main stage, the 2014 Summit will include thematic breakout sessions with leaders from a diverse spectrum of experience, an expanded Civic Tech Fair highlighting the latest in cutting-edge technology solutions, and plenty of time to connect with and learn from peers.

Civic technology leaders from around the world have described the CfA Summit as a powerful convening for inspiration and collaboration, highlighting practical results that they can bring back to their communities.

> “Of all the conferences and or training I do, I learn more valuable applicable information in the three days of this conference than all the others combined and sets the tone and mindset for a whole year of getting stuff done.”

— Dave Michaelson, GIS Analyst with The City of Asheville, NC and Asheville Brigade Leader

> “The Summit was breathtakingly ambitious in the scope of the hoped-for transformation of government — yet surprisingly accessible for a non-technical person.”

— Susan Clark, Institute for Local Government

> “Code for America has transformed the way I think about getting things accomplished in the public space. It’s introduced new concepts that, as a 20-years inside the bureaucracy government practitioner, have really changed the way I think about the work that I do.”

— Jeff Friedman, Fmr. Co-Director, Mayor’s Office of New Urban Mechanics, Philadelphia
