Dear World Wide Web,

Happy 25th Birthday. We&#8217;ve had some amazing years together and if it weren&#8217;t for you, we&#8217;d never have grown from being a baby organization to a full-fledged movement. You&#8217;ve hosted some of our best efforts.

From helping our 3000+ Brigade members organize, to being the town hall for our government network, to helping us redeploy and redistribute our Fellowship apps — you&#8217;ve helped us blossom from a bunch of earnest nerds to a team of geeky change-makers.

World Wide Web — you&#8217;ve made us cool by association, and we&#8217;re so grateful for your friendship.

If it weren&#8217;t for you, we might be distributing a paper zine and working in complete obscurity under the name &#8220;Type for America&#8221; or just &#8220;For America.&#8221; And while each of these are perfectly decent monickers, there&#8217;s something essential about that connection you bring that makes our work so much more meaningful.

When your father Tim Berners Lee first unveiled you, only a few early-adopters took note. Today, we&#8217;re not surfing you or driving on your information super highways, we&#8217;re a part of you, and you are the machine-readable manifestation of our hopes, dreams, and in some cases, our well-archived follies.

So, Happy Birthday World Wide Web. We&#8217;ve had some good times indeed. Here&#8217;s to 25 more years of cats, camaraderie, and code.

Love,

Code for America
