Over the course of my career, I have often seen how hierarchical and legacy systems can stifle skilled and talented developers hoping to promote innovation. Trying to improve the infrastructure used to manage IT projects is often met with varying degrees of hostility and resentment. That&#8217;s understandable, though, as often the value of change isn&#8217;t always easy to grasp. It is clear to me that many local government IT organizations require a compelling alternative to change to be presented to them in the form of a success story or case study _from_ a local government agency.

I am very excited to be a part of CfA&#8217;s success stories, and am looking forward to subsequently using those as case studies to help to change my local government for the better.
