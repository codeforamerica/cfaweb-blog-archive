That is why for the past two years, the city of Philadelphia has participated in the Code for America fellowship program, a unique program designed to unlock the potential for technology to make our city better.

In its inaugural year, 2011, they sent five web developers and designers to Philadelphia, and throughout the year the fellows collaborated with community members, local groups and associations, and various city departments to not only build innovative technology, but also develop a local movement of open government advocates that I’ve seen firsthand make a real difference in the city. In particular, they launched a civic action platform, <a href="http://philly.changeby.us/#start" target="_blank">Change By Us</a>, which in the past few months has generated more than 400 new ideas to make <a href="http://www.phila.gov/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank">Philadelphia</a> smarter, greener, and safer. This is just the start. The real impact from this partnership will be the ongoing dialogue and collaboration the with the constituents of Philadelphia.

I strongly believe that Code for America is an asset to city governments. Cities can <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/cities/2013-city-interest-form/" target="_blank">apply</a> to the 2013 Fellowship Program now!
