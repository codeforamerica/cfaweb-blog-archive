Over the past five years, we’ve worked with more than 30 government partners through the Code for America Fellowship. Will your government be next? [Apply to be a government partner for our 2016 Fellowship today](http://www.codeforamerica.org/forms/governments/fellowship/apply/) and help reshape how you provide digital services to your community.

The [Fellowship program](http://www.codeforamerica.org/governments/fellowship/) embeds teams of civic-minded developers, designers, and product managers in local governments across the country to work full-time for a year in partnership with government officials. The fellows apply [21st Century Government Principles](http://www.codeforamerica.org/governments/principles/) to important problems focused on health, economic development, and safety and justice.

For instance, last year in [Long Beach, California](http://www.codeforamerica.org/governments/longbeach/), fellows helped the city break down silos to use data from multiple departments and get residents the help they need before ending up in the emergency room. The multi-disciplinary fellowship team built AddressIQ, an application that gathers data from fire and police department calls, cross-references addresses with business licenses, and then surfaces businesses with high emergency care rates. Using that information, safety personnel and city staff can better understand the needs of those in the community, and coordinate an intervention before somebody has an emergency. 

Long Beach Mayor Robert Garcia said, &#8220;Our experiences with Code for America have helped us increase capacity to approach tough issues with new techniques and innovative thinking. What’s more, we’ve helped prove that lean, iterative approaches to building technology and user-centered design can make the safety net smarter.&#8221;

While it’s just the beginning of 2015, we’re actively engaging in conversations with local governments around the U.S. to explore where and how Code for America can help  government work better for the people, by the people, in the 21st century. In 2016, Code for America is focusing on [three key areas of human impact](http://www.codeforamerica.org/our-work/focus-areas/):

  1. **Health** &#8212; we work to improve the health of individuals and communities through the enrollment, usability, and delivery of key health and human services for the safety net.
  2. **Safety/Justice** &#8212; we believe better use of data and technology can lead more efficient and effective use of law enforcement and other resources, to make our communities safer and keep people from cycling in and out of jail.
  3. **Economic Development**  &#8211; we redesign how workers, entrepreneurs, and businesses interact with local government to foster the kind of growth a whole community can participate in.

Our goal is to work with eight governments in these three focus areas, in partnership with community experts, foundations, and other partners with expertise in each field. Like in years past, we expect to have significant interest and applications from governments.

Looking forward to an exciting and impactful 2016!
