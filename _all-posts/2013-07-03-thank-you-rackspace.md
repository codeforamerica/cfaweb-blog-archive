  Yesterday, <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/">Rackspace</a> joined Code for America in a big way. Rackspace now offers their employees year long sabbaticals in order to join our community  of civic hackers — our Fellowship — with the option to <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/blog/how-rackspace-supports-code-for-america-fellows/">return to Rackspace post-fellowship</a>.

  <strong>Take a year off. Learn cool stuff. Code for America.</strong>
</p>

We know that Rackspace has many opportunities to partner with incredible organizations around the country and are grateful for their support of our fellowship and our mission of creating simple, beautiful, and easy to use government tools. We are excited to welcome civic-oriented “Rackers” [to apply](http://www.codeforamerica.org/apply)! (Deadline July 31.)

This collaboration is not only a great asset to our fellowship recruitment process but adds great value to our organization. Not only does it provide another pool of top talent for Code for America, but provides Rackspace premier access the talented pool of developers and designers who will pour onto the market come fellowship&#8217;s end — let&#8217;s not forget to mention that Rackspace was ranked [15th Best Place to Work in 2013](http://www.rackspace.com/blog/rackspace-on-glassdoors-list-of-top-50-best-places-to-work-in-2013/) by Glassdoor and others). It also helps successful tech companies like Rackspace and Code for America share inspiration and best practices.

  As the first organization to offer employee sabbaticals for the Code for America Fellowship, we are grateful and excited for their show of support. We look forward to even deeper collaborations with them. Special shout-out to Glen Campbell of Rackspace and Shaunak Kashyap, 2013 fellow, for kickstarting this partnership!
