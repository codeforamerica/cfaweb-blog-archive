  We asked <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/">Code for America</a>’s geeks about their favorite web tools for productivity. These tools are all <strong>easy to use, require no computer programing skills, and free (at least up to a certain usage)</strong>.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  We hope some of these will help make your job easier!
</p>

Check them out and let us know if you have favorite tools that you think could help other people in government at the bottom of this post.

# **1. Map your data! [CartoDB](http://cartodb.com/)**

[<img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/EI9aYurt6pZhqpjwo1UwMJe5HMos2B_5EYOiDARFxIMP0ymSgC7byqEdU78qvlxN7Avbkcj9KifOrw6wPJm6PYoYiRhtTDCS5HnD0CTA10wsgcVkSizdX_JG" alt="" width="454px;" height="671px;" />](http://cartodb.com/)

<p dir="ltr">
  CartoDB is a web app (no installation necessary) that lets you easily put your data on a nice-looking map and share it publicly. It’s as easy as dragging and dropping your data file and clicking some buttons. CartoDB is free for up to five tables and five megabites of (public) data, with <a href="http://cartodb.com/pricing">reasonable pricing</a> after that.

# **2 & 3: Easy Web Forms & Surveys: [Google Forms](https://support.google.com/drive/answer/87809?hl=en) and [WuFoo](http://www.wufoo.com/)**

<p dir="ltr">
  Let’s face it: a lot of what government does is collect structured information from people. A not uncommon joke among the Code for America crowd is that 80 percent of government web problems could be solved with Wufoo. (This is tongue-in-cheek, of course; but barely.)
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  Google Forms provides an easy way to set up a quick, simple web forms and save the responses into a Google Drive spreadsheet (easily exportable to Excel).
</p>

</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  For more complex web forms, another option is Wufoo, which provides many more features for forms, but is somewhat more complicated.

# **4. Stop Hating Scheduling: [Doodle](http://doodle.com/?locale=en)**

[<img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/lKEgvZIoSxXU9CsD265IiIB0pmuFRm4UHfKm__q6hrNXrcphZMlxIhPcbc1UpNNa7htTpA-lHkcM_g_AjeePXtO4VQJ_BfW3g5olOhRD-vIiN227QOxT52bq" alt="" width="648px;" height="523px;" />](http://doodle.com/?locale=en)

<p dir="ltr">
  Stakeholder management is painful enough; scheduling shouldn’t add to the pain.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  Doodle is a dead-simple web tool for doing one thing incredibly easily: asking a bunch of people what times they’re available.
</p>

Just create a [Doodle](http://www.doodle.com/), choose some time slots, and e-mail the link.

# **5. Clean Your Messy Data: [Open Refine](http://openrefine.org/)
  
** 

<p dir="ltr">
  Most data requires a fair amount of work before it’s usable for any sort of analysis. You have random leading spaces, name misspellings, and a bunch of other issues.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  Open Refine (previously called Google Refine) is a superb visual tool for interactively cleaning up data in bulk.
