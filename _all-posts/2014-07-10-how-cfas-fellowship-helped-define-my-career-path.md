I remember the first day of the Code for America Fellowship as if it were yesterday: January 5, 2011 &#8212; the start of the 2011 class of Fellows. CfA is where I met some of the greatest people, developers, designers, and friends I’ve ever met (and that I keep in touch with to this day). It was a year full of exploration, learning, and gaining a deeper respect and appreciation for the civil servants of our cities.

Since my Fellowship at Code for America, I’ve been part of the FABERNOVEL / PARISOMA team. When I joined in early 2012, I remember leaving CfA knowing that I wanted to be part of a team of people who were not only passionate about their work but who are also working on projects that have a real impact. When I first heard of FABERNOVEL I remember thinking just how similar the two entities are. At <a title="Fabernovel" href="http://http://www.fabernovel.com/" target="_blank">FABERNOVEL</a>, “we help big companies think and act like startups,” and at <a title="Parisoma" href="http://www.parisoma.com/about/" target="_blank">PARISOMA</a>, “we help ideas meet execution” as a coworking and <a title="Fabernovel event space" href="http://www.fabernovel.com/work/designer-as-founder/" target="_blank">event</a> space with a diverse community. All of this felt very much in the spirit of CfA, as our day to day consists of not only helping prototype solutions but also executing with a diverse team of creators and doers.

Code for America was my transition into interactive design and where I gained some of my most memorable and formative professional experiences. Not to mention, it was my first exposure to product development from beginning to end. Since my start at FABERNOVEL, I’ve worked with amazing project managers, user interface, user experience, and service designers, and all sorts of analysts and researchers to help prototype various solutions for a number of amazing companies. Some clients I’ve worked with include UCSF, <a title="Turnstone" href="http://www.fabernovel.com/work/turnstone-the-interactive-catalogue/" target="_blank">Turnstone</a>, <a title="SFMTA" href="http://www.fabernovel.com/work/sfmta-real-time-transit-dashboard/" target="_blank">SFMTA</a>, and more recently a <a title="Knight Foundation funded project" href="http://www.fabernovel.com/work/citizenshipworks/" target="_blank">Knight Foundation funded project</a> focusing on creating new tools and technologies that help legal permanent residents become U.S. citizens.

I can attribute much of the experiences I’ve had over the last 3 years to my time at CfA: I’ve been able to apply what I learned during my time at CfA to the projects that I’ve since been fortunate to be a part of. When I look back now, I realize how lucky I was to be a part of such an amazing movement, surrounded by industry experts who were not only amazing at what they do but also passionate about making a difference with technology as a means of change. It’s been almost 5 years since the first class of fellows began their CfA journey and I can honestly say if asked to do it again I’d do it again in a heart beat. Code for America gave me the tools necessary to use what I love to do as a means for giving back to a nation that has given me so much.
