Our Chief Program Officer Bob Sofman touts one of Code for America’s core values as “early and often transparent communication.” For me, this value has been an integral part of my experience here at Code for America, and our fellowship projects are no exception. Last year 2013 Fellow Ezra Spier (now Community Development Manager at [Other Machine Co](http://othermachine.co/).) and others suggested an idea that could help CfA Fellowship teams live up to that value in a powerful way: Code for America could run a mid-year conference, a “mini-Summit,” if you will. They thought it would provide a behind-the-scenes look into the Fellows’ process, and an opportunity for them to receive feedback on their projects thus far.

In the spirit of constant improvement, I’m proud to say we’re now bringing that idea to life. And just like our Fellowship projects are currently in the prototype phase, this event is an experiment in living our value of transparency.

Whereas the Summit will feature the culminating stories of our fellows&#8217; year long collaboration with local government, at BETA we aspire to give you, our valued community members in the civic technology movement, a mid-year look under the hood. **Give us your thoughts** on how to overcome the challenges we face navigating local government. **Cheer us on** as the Fellows hit the halfway mark of their year of service. **Hear the stories** of the technologists who are tackling tough problems from inside city hall. With your help, we can make the technologies, policies, and designs we build even more relevant and useful.

We’re excited to host you all for this wonderful evening of storytelling-in-progress. <a title="BETA" href="http://beta.codeforamerica.org" target="_blank"><b>RSVP here.</b></a> And for remote folks &#8211; we’ll be releasing videos of BETA to our wider audience so that you can be part of the experience (you can also follow along at **#cfabeta**). We look forward to sharing with you!

Hats off to Tiffany Chu, Wendy Fong, Kavi Harshawat, David Leonard, Ainsley Wagoner, Molly Mcleod, and the rest of the team bringing BETA to you.
