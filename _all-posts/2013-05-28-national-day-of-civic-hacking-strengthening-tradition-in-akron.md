  <em>In preserving the land for future generations, we will preserve something of ourselves. If we all have an interest in this land, then we all have a stake in its preservation. There is no more worthwhile cause.”</em> — Congressman John Seiberling
</p>

_<a href="http://hackneo.org/" target="_blank">Join us at HackNEO</a> on June 1 &#8211; 2 in downtown Akron to help advance the cause of ecosystem conservation in Northeast Ohio._

  We often talk about about how technology can enable change. New tools and new ways of doing business can help governments deliver public services more effectively. The words “new” and “change” help get people’s attention, but our work can often be described as something equally important: strengthening tradition.
</p>

Traditions are culture manifest. They reflect the priorities our community holds closest. In Summit County, Ohio the quintessentially American tradition of conservation has played itself out across generations. The result is a brilliant network of parks, trails, and reserves that span the county—more than 30,000 acres in all. How did this happen in the middle of a metropolis home to almost 3.5 million Americans, no less? How did a landscape known for its dedication to industry become home to vast landscapes dedicated to sustainability?

There was no big government fiat that dictated Northeast Ohio change its relationship to the land. Nor was it result of some invisible hand acting on market demand for wilderness. Instead, it is fruit from the labor of many. It resulted, in the parlance of <a href="http://www.stevenberlinjohnson.com/" target="_blank">Steven Johnson</a>, from a pre-digital <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKHDIXn5ZcE" target="_blank">“peer network.”</a> It is the work by citizens, elected officials, local corporations, non-profits, and governments at every level.

<p dir="ltr">
  The seven-term <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Seiberling" target="_blank">Congressman John Seiberling</a> exemplified this ethic. A member of the broader American environmental movement, Seiberling organized local officials and corporate leaders. He negotiated with an array of Washington officials, and he galvanized public support. As a result of his tireless work and influence on the people around him, the <a href="http://www.nps.gov/cuva/index.htm" target="_blank">Cuyahoga Valley National Park</a> now graces the land of Northeast Ohio. <a href="http://www.summitmetroparks.org/insidemetroparks/Mission.aspx" target="_blank">Metro Parks, Serving Summit County</a> has continued to expand its acreage, and the Ohio and Erie Canal has been transformed into a car-free public right of way that extends hundreds of miles from Cleveland to Akron and beyond, forming the spine of an ambitious regional trail network. Today, these park host almost eight million annual visits, and coordinate well over 1,000 volunteers every year.

  During our time in Summit County, we are helping the government and park system partners expand the network of Ohioans dedicated to conservation of the region’s ecosystem. On June 1 &#8211; 2, the local Brigade outfit, <a href="http://codeforsummitcounty.org/" target="_blank">Code for Summit County</a>, is hosting a <a href="http://hackforchange.org/" target="_blank">National Day of Civic Hacking </a>event dubbed <a href="http://hackneo.org/" target="_blank">HackNEO</a>.
</p>

At HackNEO we will be adding trails and park features to <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/" target="_blank">OpenStreetMap</a>, mashing up <a href="http://gopro.com/" target="_blank">GoPro footage</a> with trail maps, documenting local knowledge on <a href="http://summitwiki.org/" target="_blank">SummitWiki</a>, and working to extend the open source application developed by <a href="http://www.clevelandmetroparks.com/Main/Home.aspx" target="_blank">Cleveland Metroparks</a> into Summit County. Most importantly though, we will be building relationships between dedicated public servants, passionate conservationists, and technologists that care deeply about their community and the land that supports it. Also sponsored by the <a href="https://co.summitoh.net/" target="_blank">County of Summit</a>, the <a href="http://www.knightfoundation.org/" target="_blank">Knight Foundation</a>, and companies like <a href="http://cartodb.com/" target="_blank">CartoDB</a>—the event reflects the nature of civic society itself.

Strong traditions evolve. They change along with our understanding of the world. When the Organic Act creating the National Park Service was signed in 1916, conservationists thought of parks as islands of wilderness. Today, we understand they are but the “anchor tenants” of larger, often urban, ecosystems. When Congressman Seiberling was at work, the network he cultivated was limited by the communications technologies of the time. Today, we know it is possible to build a network of conservationists, professional, and layperson, more distributed and robust that even he could have imagined. If you are in Northeast Ohio, we hope you’ll join us. After all, there is no more worthwhile cause.
