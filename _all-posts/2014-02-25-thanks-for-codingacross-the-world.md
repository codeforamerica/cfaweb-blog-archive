This past weekend, 48 communities from around the globe came together to [CodeAcross](http://www.codeforamerica.org/events/codeacross-2014/).

To all of you who came out to participate in CodeAcross — thank you!

The CodeAcross community accomplished an amazing amount in 72 hours — from inventorying more than 200 datasets to drafting open data policies to prototyping apps on top of open data and more. We’re still compiling all the results from the weekend, so stay tuned to see the full collection. In the meantime, check out the below Storify for a sampling of what happened over the weekend.

Thanks to Sunlight Foundation and Open Knowledge Foundation for co-hosting and to Microsoft and Esri for making CodeAcross possible.
