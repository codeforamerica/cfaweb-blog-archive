Hundreds if not thousands of constituents walk through the doors of Denver’s municipal buildings everyday. Some are seeking permits, some are registering their vehicles, others are paying their taxes. Most of the time, these constituents have one thing in common – they’re waiting.

This week I decided to take advantage of that simple fact by setting up a “lemonade stand” outside the Community Planning and Development department to collect feedback from constituents. The plan was pretty simple: lure in participants with the promise of free cookies and lemonade and spend a few minutes soliciting feedback. My goal was to collect as much feedback as possible but to be honest I really didn’t know how well the whole thing would pan out. Would I get sign-off to do this? Would anyone want to talk? Would a few minutes be enough time to get any useful feedback?

The set-up was easy enough. I bought two gallons of lemonade, some cups, and about 50 fresh cookies from Safeway for a grand-total of around $10. I got sign-off from the department head (with the help of the person my team&#8217;s been working most closely with in the City) and set-up shop in front of the check-in kiosk where I thought there would be a lot of foot-traffic.

As a proof of concept, this exercise was a pretty huge success. I got five participants over the course of just an hour. Each sat down and provided rich feedback to the following questions

  1. What are some things you like about your neighborhood?
  2. What are some things you dislike about your neighborhood?
  3. If you could get the City to build a mobile app to fix something in the city, what problem would it solve?

I also learned a lot …

  * Get sign-off – I got a few raised eyebrows from staff working at the department but whenever anyone asked, I just mentioned that I had permission from the head of the department and they relaxed.
  * Position yourself – Sitting behind the department counter didn’t work out. First, people thought I was affiliated with the department and started asking me logistical questions about filing permits. I also got the sense people were less likely to speak with me when I sat behind the desk so I swung around and sat right next to where a participant would be sitting. I felt this changed the perceived dynamic from “interview” to “conversation” and made me seem more approachable.
  * Sell yourself – I played around with a few different signs. The first ones started off a bit text heavy as you can see below, but the sign that got the most attention was the simplest – “FREE COOKIES.” After I got their attention, I found that setting participants’ expectations by stating “It’ll only take a minute!” got more people to sit down and talk. Participants who were concerned about the time at first would stay longer once they started talking.

  * Consider context –  I thought I’d have a couple hours to collect feedback at the end of the day from 3:00 &#8211; 5:00 p.m. but the department offices close at 4:00 p.m. leaving me with just an hour. People were more willing to give feedback after they had finished their business with the City so I often caught their attention while they were running in got them to sit down on the way out. I also found that participants had a lot of unsolicited feedback about the permitting process they had just gone through. I let them talk it out before asking my own questions.

Organizations often use the excuse that there is too much overhead to conduct user research on projects they are working on. This exercise demonstrates that very little effort and few resources are needed to get great feedback from constituents. My next goal is to get the City to start collecting feedback like this on a regular basis (hopefully weekly). I’d like to try out different locations like the DMV, tax office, excise and licensing, city hall, etc. And I think next time I’m gonna use donuts  <img src="https://www.codeforamerica.org/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
