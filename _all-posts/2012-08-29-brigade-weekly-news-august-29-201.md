Our weekly report on what civic hackers & open gov advocates are doing, saying, and sharing:

## 1. [Mid Atlantic Osmosis](http://civic.io/2012/08/28/mid-atlantic-osmosis/ "Mark Headd's blog")

Mark Headd, outgoing Code for America government relations director and soon-to-be chief digital 0fficer for the City of Philadelphia, reported on his attendance at Baltimore&#8217;s [UnWired](http://gb.tc/unwired/ "unwired home"). It was a reaffirmation of his belief that cities can and should be doing more learn from one another.

## 2. [STL Hackathon Canceled After Social Backlash](http://philipithomas.com/2012/08/stl-hackathon-canceled-after-social-media-backlash/ "Philip I Thomas' blog")

Philip I. Thomas blogged about a hackathon planned St. Louis that was canceled after the local community of entrepreneurs railed against the terms of participation. Specifically, the hackathon required forfeiture of intellectual property. _Editor&#8217;s note: Don&#8217;t try to co-opt IP in your hackathons. Encourage, even incentivize, open source and Creative Commons licensing, so everyone has the potential to benefit, but leave it up to the teams to decide how they want to license their output._

## 3. [Baltimore’s 311 data now displayed on The Daily Brief map from Code for America’s 311 Labs](http://technicallybaltimore.com/news/baltimores-311-data-now-displayed-on-daily-brief-map-from-code-for-americas-311-labs/ "Technically Baltimore article")

Andrew Zaleski reported from the newly launched [Technically Baltimore](http://technicallybaltimore.com/ "Home page") that CfA Fellows were able to redeploy a 311 dashboard application in Baltimore and Boston originally built for Chicago. Civic app reuse for the win!

## 4. [Hack Day Manifesto](http://hackdaymanifesto.com/ "http://hackdaymanifesto.com/")

So you’re organizing a hack day or hackathon? Here are some basic requirements to make your event a success, and avoid the common pitfalls that could otherwise ruin it. If you cannot provide any of the following, make it clear to guests before registration. Attendees are generally forgiving when clear communication is given. These are only guidelines, but exist to help you run a hack day in the easiest possible way.

## 5. [Mapping the Sioux Falls Schools District](http://www.argusleader.com/newsroom/maps/ed-map/index.html "Argus Leader map page")

Derek Eder of [Open City Apps](http://opencityapps.org/ "Open City home") in Chicago published a new map template this week. Forty five minutes later someone in Sioux Falls School District (in South Dakota) replicated it. [The Argus Leader](http://www.argusleader.com/ "home page") published it to their maps newsroom.
