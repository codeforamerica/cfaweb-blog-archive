Interested in civic data and doing something meaningful with your summer?

It&#8217;s that time again for Google Summer of Code!  Code for America is honored to be selected as a [Google Summer of Code Mentoring Organization](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/org/google/gsoc2012/codeforamerica) for a second year in a row.  Every summer, Google devotes significant resources — time, money, and effort — into creating opportunities for students across the world to get involved in open source projects. The projects aren’t even their own; they are from hundreds of organizations whose commonality is their commitment to developing great, shareable, and reusable software. We’re excited to have the opportunity to engage with bright, talented coders and spend the summer working with them to build innovative civic software.

In [Google Summer of Code 2011](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/org/google/gsoc2011/codeforamerica) we were fortunate to have nine great students who spent their summer coding for America.  The students worked on some great projects that truly made an impact at Code for America.  Chris Barna worked on a prototype of the [Open 311 Dashboard](http://codeforamerica.org/2011/08/31/chriss-cfa-summer-preview-the-open311-dashboard/).  Blake Hall worked on a number of projects and created a [Interested in civic data and doing something meaningful with your summer?

(Read about his summer experience [here](http://codeforamerica.org/2011/09/02/zachs-cfa-summer-made-with-epa-data/).)  Zach&#8217;s summer ended with notice that he had been selected as a 2012 Fellow &#8212; he is now coding for America full time.  Learn more about what the GSoC students did last year [here](http://codeforamerica.org/category/interns/).
