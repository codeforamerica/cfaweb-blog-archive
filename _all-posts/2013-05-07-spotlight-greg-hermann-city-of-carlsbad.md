  <em style="font-size: 16px;">Greg Hermann’s official title at the City of Carlsbad is Senior Management Analyst, but his City business card identifies him as &#8220;head nerd.&#8221; Here&#8217;s what he does, in his words:</em>

> I work in the City Manager’s Office and help support technology and innovation initiatives. I consider myself a municipal coder, combining a passion for technology with a deep appreciation for the complex systems that make communities work. While I don’t know rails (yet), I am pretty familiar the programming language for cities, muni code. My hope is that this allows me to better connect the dots between technology, government, and communities.

> Last fall we stood up our first open source app (Adopta) with the help of our local Brigade captain. We also have a number of projects in the pipeline including an open data portal, visualization tools for budget data, and an intrapreneurship program (Carlsbad Labs).

## What civic innovation opportunity most excites you right now?

Similar to the data mashups the travel site <a href="http://www.hipmunk.com/" target="_blank">Hipmunk</a> uses as a new way to sort through flight and hotel options, I&#8217;m curious about how we can put a lot of data together to create new metrics for communities. Neighborhodness might be a mashup of crime data, proximity to a park or community garden, presence of a local social network like <a href="https://nextdoor.com/" target="_blank">Nextdoor</a>, etc.

I’ve also recently been bugging CFA staff about trying a reverse fellowship – sending someone from local gov into a tech company.

## What do your (non-government) friends think you do?

Oh, probably some version of Amy Poehler&#8217;s character on Parks & Rec. But, in fairness it can be difficult to explain what my role is. The best description I&#8217;ve ever heard about the work of cities came from my City Manager in Palo Alto, Jim Keene. He said the real role of cities is &#8220;to establish and maintain agreements on how we are going to live together.&#8221; To that extent I think public service is a little like being the contract administrator for civil society which led me to my current Twitter bio &#8220;keeper of the social contract.&#8221;
