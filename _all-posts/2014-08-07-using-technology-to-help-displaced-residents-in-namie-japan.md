**Background information About Namie**
  
Namie is a town in Futaba District, Fukushima Prefecture, Japan and has a population of 21,000 people. The town was hit hard by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_T%C5%8Dhoku_earthquake_and_tsunami" target="_blank">2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami</a>, damage that was compounded by the devastating <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fukushima_Daiichi_nuclear_disaster" target="_blank">nuclear power plant accident</a> that followed. Due to dangerously high radiation levels the whole town was evacuated and after three years residents are still unable to return to their hometown.

By harnessing existing tools and starting a <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/about/fellowship/" target="_blank">Code for America-inspired Fellowship program</a>, Code for Japan, and its subsidiary Code for Namie, are working to find ways to use technology to help people connect and overcome Namie&#8217;s recent challenges in ways that would have proven impossible in a different, less technologically-advanced time. Here is the first chapter of this journey.

**Using YouTube and Google to Begin Outreach**
  
Shortly after the disasters, residents had no way of learning about what continued to unfold in their abandoned town. TV stations would often times not broadcast the stories related to what was happening in Namie and, even if they did, stories were typically incomplete. Whatever coverage that aired was broadcast once and not made available elsewhere. This made residents who were already displaced feel even less connected to their town. To address this information deficit, the Mayor of Namie, Tamotsu Baba, realized that he could use YouTube to communicate with his displaced constituents.

My colleagues from Google built upon this successful use of technology to support the forging of Namie’s virtual community. We helped Namie government officials hold virtual meetings through Google Hangout and collaborated to drive <a href="http://www.google.com/maps/about/behind-the-scenes/streetview/" target="_blank">Google Street View Cars</a> through Namie to capture panoramic images of the abandoned city and give Namie citizens a way to easily view the home they had been forced to leave behind.

**Addressing Additional Challenges**
  
While efforts such as these had great impact, we at Code for Japan were still concerned about how to reach former Namie residents who aren’t as comfortable with technology. Trying to build a community using digital means is especially difficult when citizens are not familiar or comfortable with using the Internet or mobile devices. Many of Namie’s community members also don’t have access to tech interfaces (tablets or computers) and struggle with smaller devices. Otsuchi is a town that was also hit by a tsunami. I visited the temporary housing facilities for these evacuees and spoke with an older gentleman there. While he had a smart-phone, he preferred to only use the voice features, mainly because the screen was too small for him to view any other applications easily. His story is shared by many of Namie&#8217;s former residents.

**Code for Namie**
  
Namie is initiating a Fellowship program, Code for Namie, modeled off the Code for America Fellowship program to use technology to begin to bridge these digital divides and to bring together Namie’s displaced community. The program convenes technologists, city planners, and local government officials who work together to build apps with displaced Namie residents in mind. We are helping Namie, in the face of grave challenges, sustain its sense of community. First, we worked to put the technology infrastructure in place. Code for Japan and Code for Namie are working with the town of Namie to distribute tablets to every single Namie household, totaling approximately 10,000. Then, the Fellows will build applications to uphold Namie’s community and better connect Namie’s former residents with their government representatives.

We have realized that starting a Fellowship program in Japan is no small task. Our goals are complex. We want to tackle large scale issues and make life better for Namie’s people. For example, we aim to: address communication concerns for citizens in diaspora, create access to resources, and track the ongoing recovery efforts associated with the tragic disasters. We plan to start small, and build upon the Fellowship to create sustainable technology practices. We have outlined three key steps:

  1. Distribute tablets to all Namie households.
  2. Recruit Fellows to run workshops that help citizens utilize their new resources.
  3. Empower the Fellows to build communication platforms that connect citizens who have evacuated all over Japan.

Our need for a Fellowship in Namie is desperate. According to a recent survey of dispersed citizens, the number of people wanting to return to their hometown is decreasing rapidly. If we do not rebuild the connection between citizens and Namie now, the town is in jeopardy of being forgotten. The Fellowship program will give Namie a fighting chance to reconnect members of their community. This is only the beginning and we hope that Code for Japan and Code for Namie specifically can play a role in keeping this community woven together even when disaster has pulled them geographically apart.

While in Japan, she initiated various projects including Hack For Japan, an initiative to use technology for Japan to recover from the M9.0 earthquake, tsunami, and nuclear power plant disaster in Tohoku region in Japan. She was also involved in Tohoku Tech Dojo, an organization that teaches youngsters how to code to cultivate new industry and help the region recover from the disaster.  Additionally, she worked with Fukko Hangout, working to help people in Tohoku to convey their message directly to the public using the Internet, and Project311, an initiative to analyze data after the Tohoku earthquake to learn and prepare for future natural disasters.
