Last Tuesday we had a solid open house here at the CfA office. It was a great time for team project demos, light bites, and engaging conversation. Thank you to all those who came out!

Below are some photos taken by CfA 2011 fellow [Ryan Resella](http://codeforamerica.org/author/ryan/) to recap the event.
