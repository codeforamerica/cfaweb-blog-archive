  You have one year. What can you do for your country? It sounds trite, but take a moment and consider it.

  I spent 2012 helping Medicaid agencies prepare for the Affordable Care Act. It was a tedious saga filled with missing data, confused documentation, and long nights struggling to glean meaning from bits of knowledge. And while I learned a tremendous amount about Medicaid, I learned so much more about my own government. I learned that some of our most important data is only available via snail mail, that a big chunk of federally funded research never reaches the public, that some agencies use 30-year-old mainframes with closed proprietary software, and that many of the poorest Americans don&#8217;t understand what public benefits they are entitled to. But most importantly, I learned that there is a better way. People are hungry for solutions, and the solutions are here.

  The Code for America community is bridging a cultural chasm and building a new kind of public good: the data infrastructure for our country. This infrastructure is a growing patchwork of open source tools to collect, process, and disseminate government data. It&#8217;s cheap to build, free to copy, and is quickly becoming a platform for greatness. It&#8217;s the low hanging fruit of public service. I had one year, and I am thrilled to be coding for America.
