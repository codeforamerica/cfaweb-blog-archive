 <img style="float: left; padding-right: 15px;" alt="Lance_headshot" src="http://www.codeforamerica.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Lance_headshot.png" />Lance Ahern (<a href="https://twitter.com/ahernlj" target="_self" data-cke-saved-href="https://twitter.com/ahernlj">@ahernlj</a>) has spent 30 years as a professional technologist, he&#8217;s founded multiple startups and served as a data processing manager for the State of Alaska’s Department of Public Safety. Now as Anchorage&#8217;s Chief Information Officer he is a fervent supporter of the local technology and startup communities.

_&#8220;Success in leadership positions requires that you bring your whole life experience to bear in understanding and resolving your organizations issue.&#8221;_

#### What&#8217;s your most valuable takeaway from your private sector experience when approaching government challenges?

I am often asked the difference between success in industry vs. government. Years ago my son made the switch from recreational to competitive soccer. At that age, any recreational player can be successful at competitive soccer. The big difference is the parents. Competitive teams require strong team managers as a buffer for the intense parents so that coaches can just focus on coaching the players.

Every CIO and leader, public or private, navigates organizational politics. While private industry is often the model that government aspires to, local government is clearly the Competitive League of organizational politics.

In government, there are a seemingly infinite number of “Competitive parents,” they never ever stop, and governments are extremely reactive to the events of the day with few buffers to prevent short term fires from impacting long term goals.

#### When becoming CIO you were tasked with consolidating IT teams across departments, how has this reorganization effected the overall effectiveness of IT?

When the Anchorage CFO recruited me from the State of Alaska to the CIO position, it was clear there would be a strong focus on implementing an enterprise IT vision for the City. Despite the momentum behind enterprise IT consolidation, it never happened. IT consolidation cannot be successful if it is seen as being imposed on the organization without clear support from ALL senior managers.

In a business, the CEO can make a decision and push it down and make it work. In government, every newspaper headline, letter to the editor, meeting between an elected official and an unhappy donor will be refracted into an IT decision that was forced onto the business. Resources and time are extremely limited; without full support from the entire executive management team, don’t even start down the path of IT consolidation.

#### Were you able to bring a startup mentality (quick turnaround, iteration, testing&#8230;) or methods of innovation to Anchorage?

While Anchorage was never seriously lagging in our IT services, recently, we have not been leaders. Although I never expected to bring a startup mentality to local government, I had a strong long term vision for how the city needed to evolve to meet the expectations of our citizens and local businesses, who adopt new technology at a frenetic pace.

As CIO, it is not enough to try move the IT organization, or even the city bureaucracy; you’ve got to move the whole ecosystem. You have to support demand from citizens who have high expectation for government services whenever and wherever they are. You have to meet with local technology companies and push them to propose Open Data based solutions to the departments they work with on a daily basis, and who trust their guidance more than edicts from “Big IT.” You have to continually seed the field for the next CIO, knowing the seeds you are planting will be critical to the success and stability of the future local economy.

#### How have you engaged citizens in achieving a more accessible and trustworthy government?

As Code for America has grown, I think Anchorage has really been successful at leveraging the CfA mission. While our difficult SAP implementation has hijacked my recent efforts to join the City Program, local civic.geeks and partners have been an incredible force in establishing a local Brigade, hosting Hackathons and a MakerFaire, and coming together for events like Race for Reuse, CodeAcross, and National Day of Civic Hacking. Our successes may be small, but we iterate and put products out quickly. We are agile.

I was initially concerned that local civic.geeks could not be successful without guidance and participation from the City and our IT resources. I was very wrong. Our citizens are just waiting to be engaged. If we show them that we are supportive and can be responsive to their relatively minimal needs, they are more than willing to donate their time and experience to enrich our public mission.

#### Any advise for CIOs across the country who are working to build 21st century cities?

Seize the Day. This is like the internet in 1996; you have a window of opportunity to support permanent positive changes in your city’s culture: Maximize the Opportunity.
