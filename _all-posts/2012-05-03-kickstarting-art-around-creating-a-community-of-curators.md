Last year as 2011 fellows, we pursued a <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/2011/11/22/explore-city-art-3-ways-on-foursquare-twitter-mobile-sites/" target="_blank">small idea</a> to build an application that helps you map, learn, and discover public and street art.

We worked with city government arts commissions and departments in Boston, Philadelphia, Seattle, and San Francisco (and a guy from Portland named Matt Blair) to help others find public art via a mobile application; John Mertens and Max Ogden built a way to Tweet images taken with a smartphone to a map (<a href="http://www.artmapper.org" target="_blank">http://www.artmapper.org</a>); we collaborated with Foursquare to allow people to check-in to more than 3,000 pieces of public art in these four cities.

We had plans to do more &#8212; to combine all these efforts into one piece of technology &#8212; but time and resources ran short. Eleven months quickly came to an end. Max, John, and I moved on to the employment hunt, post-fellowship.

Sometime last summer, a woman named <a href="http://sunlightfoundation.com/people/lmccann/" target="_blank">Laurenellen McCann</a> from the Sunlight Foundation emailed us about what she was up to in Washington, D.C. She had built something called <a href="http://theartaround.us" target="_blank">Art Around</a> and it was kind of, well, exactly what we were trying to build during our Code for America fellowship.

One thing that a year with Code for America has taught me is that innovation does not belong to any one person. And more to that end, to even begin to create something new, you need to move mountains, and to do that you need villages &#8212; no armies &#8212; of people pulling in the same direction. You don&#8217;t do it alone.

Keeping that spirit with me, months later, Laurenellen and I finally connected, and ever since our first conversation, we&#8217;ve been scheming to work together. Today, I&#8217;m excited to announce, we launch our <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/925121278/artaround-sf-smartphone-app-find-and-map-your-favo" target="_blank">Kickstarter campaign</a> to bring Art Around to San Francisco:
