Our weekly report on what civic hackers and open gov advocates are doing, saying, and sharing:

## 1. <a href="http://kalov.net/strike/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Child Care Options in Case of a Strike (Chicago)</a>

[Chicago Brigade](http://www.meetup.com/cfabrigade/Chicago/) member and [Open Gov Hack Night](http://opencityapps.org/#events "open city apps events page") regular [Josh Kalov](https://twitter.com/shua123 "josh's twitter") saw that a teachers&#8217; strike in Chicago was imminent. Armed with data and his civic hacker know-how, Josh quickly published this map. The Mayor saw it and shared it. A few days later Chicago Public Schools published [a similar map](http://cps.edu/ChildrenFirst/Pages/ChildrenFirstLocator.aspx "cps.edu"). Coincidence? We think not.

## 2. [What to Do When Open Data Is Either Wrong, Scandalous, or Both? | TechPresident](http://techpresident.com/news/wegov/22768/open-data-open-questions-unclear-action-where-do-we-go-here)

David Eaves published this brief and brilliant article on the trappings of open data by way of recent example. It seems that either some government organizations in the U.K. are running at ridiculous amounts of overhead or the data are incorrect. My take-away: the more data we open the more responsibility we have to verify correctness in sources and the validity of correlations and conclusions

## 4. <a href="http://savannahnow.com/exchange/2012-09-17/geekend-finalizes-2012-conference-schedule#.UFeUh6TyboZ" target="_blank">Geekend Finalizes 2012 Conference Schedule | savannahnow.com</a>

I&#8217;m delivering the closing keynote for [Geek-end](http://www.geek-end.com/ "geek-end home"), an &#8220;interactive conference phenomenon&#8221; in Savannah, Ga. where &#8220;the brightest geeks, designers, developers, artists, and social media mavericks&#8230;for several days filled with cutting edge speakers, fun-filled after parties, and amazing networking opportunities.&#8221; This is an article about my talk, &#8220;Hacking as a Civic Duty.&#8221;

## 5. <a href="https://gist.github.com/3623582" target="_blank">Open Data Executive Order for the City of Philadelphia — Gist</a>

Philadelphia&#8217;s newly appointed Chief Digital Officer Mark Headd emailed me a link to this handy, open source template for open government. It&#8217;s the Executive Order from Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter. [Fork, commit, push!](http://brigade.codeforamerica.org/pages/opensource "open source page")

## 6. <a href="http://www.azavea.com/blogs/atlas/2012/09/hacks-for-democracy/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Hacks For Democracy Round 1 Complete | Azavea Atlas</a>

Azavea has been a long time host and supporter of hackathons for civic good. Founder and President [Robert Cheetham](http://www.azavea.com/about-us/staff-profiles/robert-cheetham/) once told me that he considered it his patriotic duty. Here is a report on the results of the recently hosted Hacks for Democracy.
