  We think it&#8217;s safe to say that growing local business is a common goal for most cities. It builds community character, fosters  job growth, and contributes to local reinvestment, just to name a few benefits. Many local governments operate economic development agencies, offices or groups to support independent entrepreneurs, but with <a href="http://www.dof.ca.gov/redevelopment/">increasing budget cuts and support programs being dissolved</a>, access to capital for those outside the mainstream financial markets — often the aspiring small business owners — is shrinking.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  Spurred by this need, we’ve seen forward-thinking local governments build creative partnerships with established and trusted organizations to supplement these disappearing economic drivers. At Code for America, we often talk about how local government can augment their own capacity by collaborating with others, and this is a prime example.  Through programs like Kiva Zip, cities are working with outside organizations to help provide venues for small businesses to access local capital through microloans.

### The Kiva Zip Model: Piloting with the City of Oakland

Three years ago, San Francisco based non-profit Kiva launched Kiva Zip, a program that allows small business owners to receive zero interest, quick turnaround loans of up to $5,000 directly from local investors. This is a bridge for those who may not have good traditional credit to access capital. In order to ensure that potential borrowers have trustworthy social capital, Kiva Zip requires them all to be endorsed by a Trustee who vouches for their character and creditworthiness. Trustees can be individuals, community organizations, nonprofits, or even local governments. By taking on the role of trustee, local government can support local entrepreneurs in accessing 0 percent interest microloans instead of relying on long term planning by redevelopment agencies.

The City of Oakland, Calif. and the City of San Leandro, Calif. have both recently engaged in partnerships with Kiva Zip in this manner. The Peer Network spoke to Jonny Price (director of Kiva Zip), Kiran Jain (Assistant City Attorney for the City of Oakland) and Justin Proffitt (Development Specialist at the City San Leandro) about their experiences deploying Kiva Zip.

To kickstart the program in Oakland, Kiran met with the city administrator, attorney, Office of Workforce and Economic Development (OEWD) and the Business Assistance Center gathering them for a presentation of the program by Jonny. After getting these stakeholders on board with the idea, Kiran drafted a [resolution](https://oakland.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=1420160&GUID=14D6F850-D79D-48E2-9A6A-1A1DCC163E9A) to authorize the City to enter into a Trustee Agreement with Kiva, with support from City Attorney Barbara Parker and councilmember Libby Schaaf.

On May 21, 2013, the Oakland City Council passed the resolution, making Oakland [the first Kiva Zip City Trustee in the country](http://blog.sfgate.com/inoakland/2013/07/26/kiva-zip-teams-up-with-city-of-oakland-to-offer-small-business-loans-oakland-local/).

A few factors allowed for quick implementation in Oakland:

<li dir="ltr">
  <p dir="ltr">
    Kiva Zip costs nothing for the City but staff time.
  </p>
</li>

<li dir="ltr">
  <p dir="ltr">
    The City is not a guarantor on the loans — there’s no financial liability. The City simply ties their own reputation to the repayment rate of the borrowers they endorse.
  </p>
</li>

<li dir="ltr">
  <p dir="ltr">
    All endorsed borrowers, loans made, and repayment rates on shared transparently on the Kiva site.
  </p>
</li>

The [Oakland Business Assistance Center](http://www.oaklandbac.com/) (BAC) helped develop a vetting process to choose borrowers with support from Kiva. The BAC decided that all vetting would be done in-house — largely by Juno Thomas, an Urban Economic Analyst for the City. The process would look at debt to income ratios, business plans, and operational standings as main criteria for potential borrowers.

To build community awareness for the program, the City reached out to its BAC database, online assessment lists, service organizations such as the Chamber of Commerce, the Hispanic COC, the African American COC, other existing Kiva Zip Trustees, business development groups, and OEWD contacts. So far, [three business owners have been chosen to receive Oakland’s endorsement](https://zip.kiva.org/trustees/573). To date, they have collectively received $15,000 of funding and have a repayment rate of 100 percent. Kiran is proud to say all three are women-owned minority businesses.

### Expanding to San Leandro

In San Leandro, the Office of Business Development is weaving Kiva Zip into existing support programs. Through their Commercial Facade Improvement program, potential borrowers can use Kiva Zip to raise funds, enabling them to unlock forgivable matching loans from the city. As a Kiva Zip Trustee, the City of San Leandro can help support borrowers by expediting the permitting process, setting up special reviews, and launch new businesses quickly.

In both of these cities, the local government acting as a City Trustee brings community benefits:

<li dir="ltr">
  <p dir="ltr">
    Tangible support for small business development.
  </p>
</li>

<li dir="ltr">
  <p dir="ltr">
    Engaging local investors in crowdfunding economic development in their community, and creating lasting connections between local lenders and small business owners.
  </p>
</li>

<li dir="ltr">
  <p dir="ltr">
    Creating visibility of the community to Kiva’s million strong donor database, and opening the local community to a broader global one.
  </p>
</li>

<li dir="ltr">
  <p dir="ltr">
    Providing a free way for governments to supplement cuts to economic development program funding. All that is required is staff resources, rather than financial resources.
  </p>
</li>

### Next Steps

The first step for cities is to become a Kiva Zip trustee, vetting and endorsing three initial businesses. Then, the government continue making endorsements, or make a larger commitment and become a Kiva City. Making a commitment to become a Kiva City scales the program and fosters a sustainable ecosystem of local microlending by requiring the local government to create local partnerships between elected officials, community organizations, and local financial institutions.

After two and half years, more than 650 Kiva City loans have been made totaling over $350,000,000 with an 88 percent repayment rate in the U.S.
