We thought you&#8217;d be interested to know a little about the submissions we&#8217;re [receiving](https://codeforamerica.wufoo.com/forms/race-for-reuse-submission/ "submission form") for the [Race for Reuse](http://brigade.codeforamerica.org/pages/race-for-reuse "Campaign home") campaign. Apps that are [submitted to us](https://codeforamerica.wufoo.com/forms/race-for-reuse-submission/ "submission form") by November 6 (Election Day) will be featured in national and local campaigns for civic engagement.

We&#8217;re aiming to redeploy 20 new instances of civic apps for engagement. [LocalWikis](http://commons.codeforamerica.org/apps/localwiki "commons page about localwiki") and [Adopt-a-Hydrants](http://commons.codeforamerica.org/apps/adopt-hydrant "commons page about adopta") are the most popular among new instances that are already live, at five and three respectively. At least two existing instances of Adopt-a &#8212; [Honolulu](http://sirens.honolulu.gov "Honolulu sirens") (tsunami sirens) and [Boston](http://adoptahydrant.org "adoptahydrant.org") (fire hydrants) will be included in the engagement campaign. No new instances of [Shareabouts](http://commons.codeforamerica.org/apps/shareabouts "commons page on shareabouts") or [Textizen](http://commons.codeforamerica.org/apps/textizen "commons page on textizen") have been submitted early. We&#8217;re tracking a few groups who are actively working new applications of these tools to local issues. [My neighborhood](http://kgcl.org/community/ "king's grant community league") is considering Shareabouts as a tool for communicating about the locations of traffic signs on neighborhood roads. More instances of LocalWiki and Adopt-a should be online soon, too.

I&#8217;m surprised not to see more early action for Textizen. It&#8217;s so easy and effective. All it takes is a motivated group to demonstrate it for their city. Is your city talking about important public transportation issues? [Create a Textizen poll](http://www.textizen.com/welcome "textizen home") to get input from riders while they ride.

In [Providence](http://adopt-a-hydrant-providence.herokuapp.com/ "providence instance"), R.I.; [Syracuse](http://adopt-a-hydrant-syracuse.herokuapp.com/ "syracuse instance"), N.Y.; and [Banff](http://adopt-a-hydrant-banff.herokuapp.com/ "banff instance"), Alberta, Canada folks from city government are already engaged with us in the campaign and welcome participation from their local communities with Adopt-a-Hydrant. Please [contact us](mailto:adopta@codeforamerica.org?subject=I want to volunteer for Adopta in my city "email brigade-info") if you live in one of these cities and want to volunteer for Adopt-a-Hydrant. We want local help for the local campaign and to adopt hydrants.

LocalWikis are live in [Detroit](http://detroitwiki.org/ "detroit instance"), [Oakland](http://oaklandwiki.org/ "oakland instance"), Calif., [Seattle](http://seattlewiki.net "seattle instance"), [Salt Lake City](http://saltlakewiki.org "salt lake city instance") and [Atlanta](http://wiki.openatlanta.net "atlanta instance"). The founders of LocalWiki and the national LocalWiki organizers community are already coaching the new organizers. Please [contact us](mailto:brigade-info@codeforamerica.org?subject=I%20want%20to%20volunteer%20for%20LocalWiki%20in%20my%20city "email brigade-info") if you live in one of these cities and want to volunteer for LocalWiki. We want local help for the local campaign and to &#8220;edit your city.&#8221;

After this election season lets show ourselves and each other that citizens are more than ready to work together on ordinary civic issues that need our collective attention.
