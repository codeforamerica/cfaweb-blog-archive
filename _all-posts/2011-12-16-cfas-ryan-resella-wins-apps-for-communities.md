Today, I&#8217;m so very pleased to report that one of our own, [Ryan Resella](http://codeforamerica.org/author/ryan), has won the [FCC](http://fcc.gov) And [James S. and John L. Knight Foundation&#8217;s](http://knightfoundation.org) [Apps for Communities](http://appsforcommunities.challenge.gov/) competition! Announced today at the awards ceremony in Silicon Valley, his app, [YAKB.us](http://YAKB.us), took home the grand prize of $30,000.

YAKB.us helps residents find transit information. While this may sound familiar, his version takes a inclusive approach, focusing on helping those without smartphones or dataplans learn where and when buses are arriving. With the app, you can either call or text into a set number and find the location nearest you. Since it utilizes the Tropo voice-to-text platform, there&#8217;s no call center operator required &#8212; it&#8217;s all automated. Plus, the bus stop information is available in both English and Spanish. All in all, YAKB.us seems like a smart, efficient way to enhanced access.

As you might know Ryan was one of the inaugural Code for America fellows, working on a host of different projects throughout the year. While he came with an impressive background, leading the web apps teams for the City of Santa Clarita, he didn&#8217;t let that be an excuse not to use the fellowship to grow. In fact, he started the year as a primarily .NET and GIS programmer, and he ended it as one of our leading Ruby-on-Rails developers. That is just a testament to his work ethic and passion. Code for America is now honored to have him stay on on staff as our Technical Lead, in charge of supporting the future fellows&#8217; technical education and infrastructure. Given Ryan&#8217;s experience in City Hall and in our fellowship &#8212; and his prize-winning coding skills &#8212; I couldn&#8217;t think of a better fit.

Congrats, Ryan!
