Last week 48 communities around the world came together for a day of civic hacking called [CodeAcross](http://www.codeforamerica.org/events/codeacross-2014/). From Arlington to Alaska and Taipei to Tulsa — civic hackers, government staff, and concerned citizens joined forces to open data and connect to solve local issues. 

The event was a huge success and we want to build on that momentum. We often receive questions from city staff on how they can pave the way for greater collaboration with residents. Here are a few tactics that can carry over from CodeAcross:

<img alt="" src="http://www.codeforamerica.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/rhodeisland_2.jpg" align="right" />1. **Meet in Real Life**: Despite the fact that many of the govtech community&#8217;s applications are online, the connections made between governments and citizens are strengthened by meeting in real life. Rhode Island&#8217;s CodeAcross was hosted in the [State House Rotunda](http://www.meetup.com/Rhode-Island-Code-for-America-Brigade/) and members from seven different government agencies attended the event alongside other civic hackers and residents. Beyond CodeAcross, volunteer groups in Oakland, Calif. and Raleigh, N.C. meet regularly in a room in City Hall with local officials and government staff attending events on an on-going basis. If you work in government and want to connect with local volunteer Brigades, attend your local [hack night](http://brigade.codeforamerica.org/). Additionally, if you&#8217;ve got the space, consider hosting the Brigade in a government building. Forging a relationship in real life solidifies how much you truly value the work from volunteer groups. The presence of government staff at Brigade meetings is often also an indication of whether or not new apps are likely to be integrated into official city services.

2. **Create Open Data Policies and Inventory Your Data**: While we recognize this is sometimes not an easy feat, making a commitment to open data is a commitment to allowing room for citizen participation. CodeAcross groups in [Salt Lake City](http://opensaltlake.org/) and [Asheville, N.C.](http://codeforasheville.org/) worked on open data policies in their cities, while many others worked to inventory existing data in the Open Knowledge Foundation&#8217;s [U.S. City Open Data Census](http://us-city.census.okfn.org/). If you know of open data sources that are not listed on this site, please [submit them](http://us-city.census.okfn.org/submit/). By making this information known, you are encouraging citizens to join you in building better data visualizations, apps, and government services.

3. **Airing Grievances**: Sometimes our hometown loyalties make it hard to admit the problems our cities are facing. Nevertheless, if we truly want to embrace government as something we do together, then it&#8217;s important to admit our problems in order to address them. In [San Francisco](http://www.meetup.com/Code-for-San-Francisco-Civic-Hack-Night/), CodeAcross attendees were offered information on a number of housing-related initiatives before breaking into small groups. Meanwhile in [Chattanooga, Tenn.](http://www.meetup.com/cfabrigade/Chattanooga-TN/), community members presented seven different problem statements before breaking off into groups related to transportation, education, and mapping. The trick here is to keep revisiting local problems and allowing the group to prioritize what they&#8217;d like to work on. It&#8217;s natural for hot button issues to be the subject of an civic hackathon and the best way to keep people engaged is to keep them working on what&#8217;s needed in the community and what the people in that room are most passionate about.

4. **Offer Tools NOT Specs**: At CodeAcross in Burlington, VT., the local [Code for BTV](http://codeforbtv.org/) volunteer group facilitated a human-centered design workshop where civic hackers, community members, community organizers, non-profits, urbanists, city leaders, and staff, and others explored how open data could be used to improve the community. Meanwhile in Anchorage, Ala., the group made a point of presenting the apps and datasets available to those new to the group. Rather than telling technologists what or how to build it, city officials, and government staff simply presented a series of relevant tools and let the group come to their own conclusions.

5. **Show and Tell**: At CodeAcross in [Grand Rapids, Mich.](http://friendlycode.org/), group members demoed a number of their applications including [My Metro](http://github.com/friendlycode/mymetro) hyperlocal text notification app, [GRParking](https://github.com/friendlycode/grparking") data visualization app, and [Viget.org](http://viget.org/). Similarly, the Boston CodeAcross event featured a number of [demos](https://docs.google.com/a/codeforamerica.org/document/d/1OktmTOjT4ohO0y5ZV7laNJO9IJ7VYfQIGC8rA9nwt4c/edit). These show and tell periods are often extremely useful in inspiring ideas in government employees and civic hackers alike. Making room to look at new technology in an informal environment leaves room for collaborations and iterative products.
