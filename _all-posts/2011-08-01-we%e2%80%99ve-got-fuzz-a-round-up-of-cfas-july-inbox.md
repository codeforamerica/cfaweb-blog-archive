**_Our virtual rendition of the proverbial water cooler._** 

In the Code for America offices, we have dozens of passionate people spending their days working to make government better through technology; let&#8217;s be clear, this is hard work. But that doesn&#8217;t mean it has to be boring. In fact, everyone makes sure of that. Links to interesting articles, videos, or projects circle through the office at such speed and frequency that we had to create a separate email thread just to handle the load. 

The following is a handpicked collection of the best news, successes, and distractions that represent our collective inbox and culture. This is our Fuzz. (And yeah, that&#8217;s what we named the email alias.)

They act as connective hubs as people move to them from nearby counties and from far across the country. Basically, this map offers a far more nuanced understanding of what we already knew: Americans are more connected to each other than ever before.
