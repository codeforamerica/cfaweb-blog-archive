Government helped my family when we needed it most. I wouldn’t be here today without services that the British government provided &#8212; and that worked &#8212; for my family and me.

Now, many years later raising my own family in the U.S., I’m keenly aware of the importance of making government services simpler, faster, and more effective for all. It can mean the difference between a child going to school hungry, or being well-fed and able to learn; someone going to jail for a parking violation, or being able to clear a minor infraction without losing their job in the process, and then getting their next job without a record hanging over their head. The list goes on, and on.

I join Code for America (as the new Chief Operating Officer) at a unique time. We’re evolving from a startup tackling a huge mission with just a few staff, to an operation that can support and partner with hundreds of local governments to deliver services that meet the 21st century needs of their community. Over the past five years, Code for America has learned a lot (and I’m looking forward to diving into these learnings) about what works and what doesn’t.

We’re going big on promising areas, and we’re going deep in health, safety and justice, and economic development to show how digital government can work.

In my career, I’ve built and scaled teams multiple times to meet emerging organizational needs. I’m thrilled to do the same through Code for America’s partners, our larger Brigade network, as well as through the now more than 60 staff and Fellows we have.

I also look forward to leading Code for America’s strategic planning. Code for America has made a significant impact with its partners, but we have much more to do.

Over the next few weeks, I’ll be jumping in to learn more about Code for America’s history, our partner and client needs, and the larger civic tech ecosystem. I’m excited for what’s ahead.
