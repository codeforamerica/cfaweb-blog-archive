Today I’m happy to announce our [2015 Code for America Fellowship class](http://www.codeforamerica.org/geeks/our-geeks/2015-fellows/). These 24 individuals will work in teams of three in service of 8 communities across the country.

For the last four years, 103 individuals from across the United States have taken leave from jobs at large and small tech companies, their own businesses, and government, to use their skills for good during a year of public service.

The 24 Fellows in the [2015 class](http://www.codeforamerica.org/geeks/our-geeks/2015-fellows/) are comprised of developers, designers, researchers, product managers, cartographers, lawyers, policy wonks, and community organizers. They have worked for organizations such as NPR, Rackspace, GovLab, Zendesk, Athena Health, Spotify, Weather Underground, Modcloth and General Assembly. Some come from local governments including the City of Long Beach, the City of San Francisco, the City of Philadelphia, and Chicago Public Schools. And, this year we are also excited to welcome two Brigade captains to the cohort, who have already worked to activate their communities in San Juan, Puerto Rico, and Miami, Florida.

The incoming fellows will partner with [previously announced cities](http://www.codeforamerica.org/blog/2014/09/23/code-for-america-announces-government-partners-for-2015-fellowship-program/ "Code for America Announces Government Partners for 2015 Fellowship Program") Albuquerque, New Mexico; Indianapolis, Indiana; Miami-Dade County, Florida; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Somerville, Massachusetts; Vallejo, California; and West Sacramento, California as well as a newly announced fellowship with RVA Community Partners in Richmond, Virginia.

Please join me in welcoming this incredible new cohort to the Code for America community!
