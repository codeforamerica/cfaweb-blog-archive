Part-Pakistani, part-American, I was conceived half-way across the world in Malawi, and my roots spring from the villages of rural India. Until a college scholarship brought me to America, I was a complete product of the developing world. I grew up with a fierce desire to make things better, I often wished to be Prime Minister of Pakistan so I could make things right.

I first stepped into the User Experience (UX) Design field because I wanted people to use technology and information to work together to the advantage of human beings. After 6½ years as a UX Designer at [Yahoo!](http://yahoo.com/), I set out in search of what was at the heart of my passion, enabling technology that would have a more meaningful impact on human lives.

When I chanced upon Code for America, all the pieces suddenly fell into place. I immediately loved the CfA mission, and recognized that the cross-functional culture allowed for high standards of transparency. I knew that by joining CfA I would have the opportunity to work with brilliant and diverse minds towards a common civic goal, creating solutions that make a real difference to citizens.

While working on [Honolulu Answers](http://answers.honolulu.gov/) at CfA, I realized that I had to take my newfound skills to Pakistan where governance is a mess and there is a tremendous need for civic hacking. Post fellowship, I founded [Code for Pakistan](http://codeforpakistan.org/), introducing civic hacking to the country.

In the last year, Code for Pakistan has:

  * Run 3 civic hackathons all over the country
  * Launched a [Fellowship Program](http://www.codeforpakistan.org/blog/the-peshawar-fellowship-in-focus) with 12 awesome Fellows, in partnership with a provincial government
  * Launched a [Brigade](http://www.codeforpakistan.org/blog/lahore-brigade-meetup) in another province
  * Deployed [3 open source apps](http://codeforpakistan.org/apps)
  * Led to a [civic startup](http://savareeapp.com/)

The response has been incredible; people in Pakistan are so excited about having a platform to use their skills for civic betterment. At the moment, Code for Pakistan is a volunteer-run organization, but we hope to raise funds to staff and scale it further.

In addition to Code for Pakistan, since the Fellowship, I’ve been doing a part-time UX consulting job, teaching UX classes for [Girl Develop It](http://www.girldevelopit.com/chapters/san-francisco), [UC Berkeley](http://berkeley.edu/), and [PariSoMa](http://www.parisoma.com/), consulting at the [World Bank](http://www.worldbank.org/), and learning Growth at [Tradecraft](http://tradecrafted.com/).

During the Fellowship, while working round the clock as the Project Lead for Honolulu Answers, I found myself firing on all cylinders. Being surrounded by brilliant, like-missioned thought leaders, with great support from the staff, made the Fellowship magical. I realized what it meant to have a job that didn’t feel like work, I discovered what _really_ makes me tick, and I learned a lot from others. It led directly to my next step, founding <a title="Code for Pakistan" href="http://codeforpakistan.org" target="_blank">Code for Pakistan</a>.
