In our last webinar, we heard from three fellow teams about the projects they&#8217;ve been building with their cities this year:

  * [BlightStatus](http://codeforamerica.org/?cfa_project=blightstatus) (built for New Orleans)
  * [Honolulu Answers](http://codeforamerica.org/?cfa_project=honolulu-answers) (built for Honolulu)
  * [311 Labs](http://codeforamerica.org/?cfa_project=311-labs) (built for Chicago)

With the Fellowship drawing to a close in just a few weeks, many of these teams are busy polishing up their projects, continuing to spread the word in their communities about it, and discussing sustainability options with their cities. It&#8217;s the end of the Fellowship development process, but the beginning of the ongoing impact that these apps will have â€” both in the communities they were built for and in other cities across the country that reuse these tools.

The Fellowship reflects our awareness that building and launching a product is just the first step. Creating meaningful, significant civic engagement through technology requires both **adoption** of that technology by members of the community and a plan for long-term **sustainability** of the project.

That&#8217;s the idea behind our new initiative: the [Race for Reuse](http://brigade.codeforamerica.org/pages/race-for-reuse). We want to take the app contest beyond the typical end goal of prototyping a new app. We want to see you launch, engage, and sustain tools for your community &#8212; and we&#8217;ve designed this contest with milestones (and prizes!) to help you do it.

Here&#8217;s how it will work:

  * Launch one of four featured apps in your city, and earn an advertising budget to promote.
  * Reach your target for adoption, and earn a year of free hosting to sustain the civic engagement tool you&#8217;ve deployed.
  * Achieve these milestones by Thanksgiving Day, and we&#8217;ll throw you a party in your city to celebrate.

Head on over to the [Brigade](http://brigade.codeforamerica.org/pages/race-for-reuse) to find out more and sign up now. There&#8217;s options for everyone to get involved, whether you&#8217;re a coder or not.
