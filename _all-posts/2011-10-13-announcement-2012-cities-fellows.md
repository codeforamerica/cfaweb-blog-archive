      Thursday, October 13, 2011, San Francisco — Today Code for America (CfA) announced the eight cities and 26 fellows who will be participating in its 2012 program. The official announcement came earlier today at the <a href="http://summit.codeforamerica.org/">Code for America Summit</a>. The two-day Summit is the first of its kind for CfA, and has brought together technologists and government representatives from 17 cities nationwide.

      “We started with three cities in our first year; in 2012 we will be working with eight. We learned a lot in our first year, and are proud to be able to grow the program significantly” said Jennifer Pahlka, Founder and Executive Director of Code for America.

      The 2012 Code for America city partners are Austin, Chicago, Detroit, Honolulu, Macon, Ga., New Orleans, Philadelphia, and Santa Cruz, Calif. These eight cities were selected from a pool of over 20 candidates for their dedication to civic innovation; each with a cutting-edge proposal for creating a more efficient and engaged government through the use of technology. Details on each city project are available online: <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/2012">http://codeforamerica.org/2012</a>

      “We live in an age of participation, but our public institutions haven’t benefited equally from the technologies that have so dramatically changed the business and social landscape in the past decade. We’re excited to work with these eight forward-thinking cities and are extremely eager to see what this impressive class of fellows will create next year,” Pahlka said.

      Philadelphia, population 1.5 million, was so happy with the results in 2011 that they are back for the 2012 program. “I am excited that the City of Philadelphia and Code for America are partnering onward to promote civic participation, technology, and government innovation. The tool that Code for America is creating will further our efforts leveraging resources in and outside of government while reaching out to constituents,” said Philadelphia Mayor Michael A. Nutter.

      In contrast, Macon, Ga., population 91,351, demonstrates that it isn’t just big cities that are interested in technical innovation. “This is an exciting development and we’re looking to help formulate and put into place new Web applications to make it easier for citizens to be informed about and engaged with our city,” said Macon Mayor Robert Reichert.
    </p>

      The 2012 fellows were selected from of pool of 550 highly qualified applicants — all boasting top-notch credentials in their industry. The acceptance rate of under 5 percent makes the fellowship more competitive than Teach for America and many Ivy League schools.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The 2012 class includes developers, user experience designers, graphic designers, and project managers — many of whom are leaving positions at leading Internet companies such as Google, Microsoft, and Apple to take part in the service-year fellowship. They will begin their fellowship in Code for America’s San Francisco offices starting January 2012.

      Michelle Lee is one of the 2012 fellows. Michelle has worked at Google since 2005, leading projects to aid in understanding and improving user experiences in Maps, Flu Trends, and Docs. Michelle started Forms under Google’s 20% time policy, and it is now the fasting growing type of Google Doc online.

      Another 2012 fellow, Aurelio Tinio, is a web developer with more than ten years of experience. Aurelio currently works as the Lead Software Engineer at The Bay Citizen — a Knight News Prize winning Bay-Area publication. He received his Computer Science degree at UCLA while working at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Prior to joining The Bay Citizen, Aurelio worked at Tippit as a Senior Software Engineer, designing, implementing and managing Focus.com’s property.

      These are just two of the 2012 fellows; the others are just as remarkable. The full list of fellows can be found at: <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/2012-fellows">http://codeforamerica.org/2012-fellows</a>

      November will bring a close to the inaugural 2011 fellowship. The 2011 cities include Boston, Philadelphia, and Seattle. The 19 men and women in the 2011 fellowship class have produced a suite of about 40 new and innovative technologies for these three cities.
