I love America. And because of that I complain about it all the time (kind of like my relationship to the Boston Red Sox). It&#8217;s a love hate thing. It might be the most patriotic behavior I have.

I believe that many of us Americans share this mentality. Just listen next time you&#8217;re on the bus or at a party. We all have ideas on ways to improve what&#8217;s going on around us. Some of them are great ideas and others are terrible. I got tired of hearing all these opinions and would wish to myself that people would stop talking and start doing. Then I took my own medicine. I never really valued my own opinions about government. I felt that I was too uninformed to be able to be effective and I may still feel that way.

For me, this fellowship is about doing. Since we&#8217;ll be building apps for civic governments, I&#8217;ll use the iPhone/Android app markets as a metaphor. If every app developer decided that their app may not work 100% as they envision, could have a bug or no one would download it and therefor not develop that app, then we would never have apps let alone a platform to build them on. Every app developer has fears about their app yet they develop them, lots of &#8216;em. Today we have tens of thousands of apps, free and paid for, available for download because the developer was able to move past their fears.

Now not all apps are created equal, some are high-worth and others are worthless. Without the worthless apps, we may not have any apps. Even &#8220;worthless&#8221; apps (see how I moved that into quotes) have great worth. Beyond all-or-nothing, &#8220;worthless&#8221; apps provide another useful purpose; users can use them as examples to create better apps or even hack worth into them ([CatMapping](http://catmapper.com/) anyone?). 

I/we/you may have worthy ideas about how governments can function better. Get over your fears, whatever they may be, and get involved. I&#8217;m a designer by trade and when I read about what Code for America was setting out to do I was excited to see it happen and hesitant to apply because I didn&#8217;t know how I could fit in other than running photoshop for the real geeks. Since the start of this fellowship I&#8217;ve found an infinite amount of ways to get involved and am so elated to be a part of this movement.
