I joined Code for America because I believe that technology is an amazing tool to help make people&#8217;s lives better. The application of existing data to help citizens make decisions has the potential to dramatically affect the economic and political landscape. Transparency in particular is a complicated problem and I love hard problems.

Knowledge and insight requires communicating data in a way that the user can connect with and understand. This communication begins with the basic ways in which a person interacts with their community government through forms or applications and ends with a complete feedback loop where the results are delivered to the citizen in a useful manner.

My personal moment of realization comes each time I&#8217;m intimidated by a pre-printed form. I&#8217;m never sure if the number I put in box 6A isn&#8217;t supposed to be zero when box 5B is one or greater? I can only imagine that others have struggled in a similar way, but may have given up, thus diminishing the accuracy of the tool and their ability to contribute to their community. Understanding how an opinion or contribution changes one&#8217;s immediate surroundings is a valuable incentive and method of accountability. I think that technology can fill this void, but it must be easy to use, accurate, and honest.
