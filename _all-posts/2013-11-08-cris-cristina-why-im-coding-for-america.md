  Hi I&#8217;m Cris Cristina, an experience designer, and this is but one example of why I code for America. About a year ago I got pulled over for having a busted headlight and had to go downtown to pay my ticket. When I walked in to the police administration building, I was utterly dumbfounded.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  Everyone had to go through a metal detector, then choose a line. There were six different lines, and they snaked in eight different directions.  I felt as if I was in the movie &#8220;Brazil.&#8221; I couldn&#8217;t figure out which line to stand in &#8212; and I had everything going for me: English is my first language, I wasn&#8217;t pressed for time, and I wasn&#8217;t looking for anything out of the ordinary.  When I finally made it up to the front, I witnessed the lady in front of me get told she didn&#8217;t have the right paperwork, that the specialist she needed to speak with was only available for two hours every Tuesday morning, and that &#8220;no one cared about her problem.&#8221;
</p>

This appalling scenario isn&#8217;t unique, but it struck me as an inherently fixable problem. Just a few posted signs would have made a world of difference.

CfA offers the opportunity for me to apply my professional design skills and personal passions to making a difference for the public good.  Working with this diverse group of talented professionals and civic leaders, I hope we&#8217;re helping create a movement, generate some momentum, and ultimately lay a few blocks for building systemic change.
