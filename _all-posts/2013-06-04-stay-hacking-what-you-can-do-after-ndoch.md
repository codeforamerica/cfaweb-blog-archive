That was some crazy weekend, huh? More than 11,000 participants around the country came out for 95 events in 83 cities. As you reflect upon epic event that was [National Day of Civic Hacking](http://hackforchange.org) it’s important to remember that civic hacking isn’t just about hackathons and unconferences — which take place for a few hours place and end. Don’t let all that effort and energy you put into hacking for change end with the weekend. Sure, you want to take a break for awhile and enjoy the moment. You deserve it. But don’t sit back too long. National Day of Civic Hacking was a celebration — an introduction for many and a galvanizing moment for all — but civic hacking is ongoing and continuous activity. Civic hacking is a positive force for constructive change and you are a part of it.

So, how are you going to stay involved? Well, let me make it easy for you. We at Code for America do civic hacking every day. Here are a few ways to stay involved.

  Participate in the Great American Civic Hack
</h2>

The [Great American Civic Hack](http://brigade.codeforamerica.org/civic-coding) is a three month campaign to take our favorite open source, civic repos to the next level; to close issues, reach milestones, add new features, and generally make code fork and merge ready. This campaign is a great way for you to stay involved all summer. Starting this week you can join up with a nationally organized project or submit your local project to stay connected.

Finally, make sure to [submit your stories and feedback](http://hackforchange.org/blog/submit-your-projects-white-house-showcase-event-intel-more) about the weekend to make next time even better.
