In 2015, the Code for America Brigade had a unprecedented year of growth. The network grew to [133 chapters and more than 40,000 members](http://www.codeforamerica.org/brigade/numbers/). This year also saw Brigades achieve some incredible successes locally. Here&#8217;s our 2015 Brigade year in review.

### What we did together

In addition to working to build community and technology locally, Brigades came together to drive change as a network. Here&#8217;s a look at what we did together.

#### Days of action

The Code for America Brigade network hosted two days of action in 2015: Code Across and National Day of Civic Hacking.

  * CodeAcross included: 60 participating locations across the globe (13 international events); 3,162 participants; 36,900 volunteer hours contributed; and 238 local digital services evaluated in 26 cities.
  * National Day of Civic Hacking included: 100+ participating locations across the U.S.; U.S. Chief Data Scientist DJ Patil attending events in South Bend, IN and Chicago, IL; Deputy U.S. CTO Ed Felten attending Code for San Francisco’s event; the US Census Bureau’s launch of [CitySDK](http://uscensusbureau.github.io/citysdk/).

#### Network Infrastructure

In 2015, Brigades worked with Code for America staff to create infrastructure for the movement. This included the launch of these key resources:

  * [Code for America Brigade Organizer’s Playbook](https://www.codeforamerica.org/brigade/organize/playbook/): The playbook focuses on the three areas key to running a sustainable Brigade: infrastructure, organizing, and building.
  * [Code for America Brigade Project Search](http://www.codeforamerica.org/brigade/projects): Searches thousands of civic tech projects across the Brigade and Code for All networks.
  * [Civic Tech Project Stages](https://www.codeforamerica.org/brigade/projects/stages): Defined the different stages of volunteer built civic technology and started tracking the use of those stages.
  * [Code for America Issue Finder Analytics](http://www.codeforamerica.org/geeks/civicissues/analytics): Tracking the usage of the civic issue finder. Also, [exploring what makes a issue likely to get help](https://got-issues.herokuapp.com/).
  * [Code for America Brigade Numbers](https://www.codeforamerica.org/brigade/numbers):  Started accurately tracking the Brigade wide numbers. We’ve got the number of groups, people, and projects.

What a year! Thank you to the Brigade Captains, core team members, municipal partners, community partners, and everyone who contributed their time, passion, and skills to make their community a better place. Congratulations on an incredible 2015 .
