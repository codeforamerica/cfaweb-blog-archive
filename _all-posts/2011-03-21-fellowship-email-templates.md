**Seeking the next generation of tech-savvy civic leaders: The 2012 Code for America Fellowship**

Cities are under greater pressure than ever, struggling with budget cuts and outdated technology. Code for America is working to help cities leverage the power of the web to become more efficient, transparent, and participatory. We’re putting the brightest minds from the web industry to work solving the core problems facing our communities, and now, we’re looking for the next generation of tech-savvy civic leaders. Are you one of them?

Code for America is now accepting applications for its 2012 fellows program. If you’re a developer, designer, entrepreneur, analyst or researcher who wants to make a difference, this is your opportunity to build a new generation of Gov 2.0 apps to make city governments work better.

Why Become a CfA Fellow?
  
During the 11-month program, you will not only receive a living-wage stipend, travel expenses, and healthcare, but also the training and support to be positioned as a leader in business, public service, or both:

  * Professional Development. The biggest names in the web industry and the Gov 2.0 movement will provide you with unparalleled networking, mentoring, and support.
  * Alumni Connections. Working closely with other talented individuals, you will develop lasting professional relationships in a fast-paced, startup atmosphere.
  * Employer Partnerships. Multiple leading internet companies have pledged to guarantee interviews for a full-time position after CfA.
  * A Labor of Love. In a collaborative, high-energy environment, you’ll not only accomplish a lot, you’ll have a lot of fun with other passionate fellows.
