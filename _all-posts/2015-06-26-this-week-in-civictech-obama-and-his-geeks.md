The [Code for America network](http://www.codeforamerica.org/brigade/) is made up of more than 26,000 people around the world who help make their communities and governments work better. Here&#8217;s a brief snapshot of what happened across the network this week:

## Obama and his Geeks

_Fast Company_ [published a great article](https://www.fastcompany.com/3046756/obama-and-his-geeks) on our friends at the [United States Digital Service](https://www.whitehouse.gov/digital/united-states-digital-service) and [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov/). They interviewed President Obama as well as the founding members of both Federal technology organizations. We&#8217;re proud to say many from the CfA network have been, or currently are, part of this work.

## Code for Anchorage maps donation sites for the Sockeye Fire

[Code for Anchorage](http://codeforanchorage.org/) worked with [their local news station](http://www.ktuu.com/news/news/alaska-wildfires-how-you-can-help/33598452) to help with the recovery effort for a severe fire.

## Mesa AZ launches MuniciPal

The 2014 Mesa Code for America Fellowship app [launched this week](http://www.eastvalleytribune.com/local/article_5fc3df6c-1b7a-11e5-8fd9-6fcf8ac3c851.html) thanks to the hard work of the Mesa city partners. [MuniciPal](http://municipal.mesaaz.gov/?lng=-111.8624496459961&lat=33.36695073507658) makes it really easy find out what is going on in your council district.
