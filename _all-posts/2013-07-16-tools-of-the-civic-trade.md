  One of the many things I enjoy about being a Code for America fellow is being surrounded every day by <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/2013-fellows/">26 other civic technologists</a>. Working with a diverse cohort of fellows means that I get to draw from 26 backgrounds, toolboxes, and approaches to solving problems. Whenever I run into problems, there’s a good chance another fellow has faced it before – and knows how to help me out.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  In the course of the fellowship, I&#8217;ve also picked up a bunch of new apps and tools that help me get the job done. I recently asked our fellows to share a few apps they&#8217;ve found useful so far this year – and I&#8217;ve organized them into categories below.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  <strong>Productivity</strong>
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  <strong>Fluid:</strong> I&#8217;ve been using Fluid to turn all my web services into apps on my Mac. Now my <a href="https://www.rememberthemilk.com/">Remember the Milk</a> and <a href="http://teambox.com/">Teambox</a> are regular apps on my laptop that I can alt+tab between instead of hunting down which tab they are in. Protip: Google for a fluid icon for your app to replace the favicon. Available for <a href="http://fluidapp.com/">OS X</a>. <em>Andrew Hyder</em>
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  <strong>Divvy:</strong> An app that makes it super simple to resize and arrange windows. I have <a href="http://i.imgur.com/YLCwavg.png">shortcuts set up</a> for full screen, half screen (top/bottom or left/right) and quarter screen that I use to arrange multiple browser windows, terminals, text editors, etc. into workspaces. If I hadn&#8217;t already purchased Divvy, I&#8217;d consider using <a href="https://github.com/jigish/slate">Slate</a> – it&#8217;s open source and configurable in javascript. Available for <a href="http://mizage.com/divvy/">OS X</a>. <em>Ezra Spier</em>
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  <strong>Asana:</strong> Loving this as our team project management suite, but I also keep a &#8220;Personal&#8221; tag that is hidden from my team, and so allows me to use it for my own reminders (in lieu of something else like Remember The Milk). Available for <a href="http://asana.com/">browser</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.asana.app">Android</a>, and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/asana-mobile/id489969512?mt=8">iOS</a>. <em>Dave Guarino</em>
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  <strong>Pomodoro:</strong> I don&#8217;t have a favorite app, but the <a href="http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/">Pomodoro technique</a> has gotten me through many a &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to work today&#8221; days. <em>Rebecca Ackerman</em>
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  <strong>Mendeley:</strong> Mendeley is a bibliography tool/PDF editor/life organizer, and has worked well for our team. We have a shared folder of readings. Available for <a href="http://www.mendeley.com/">web</a>. <em>Rebecca Ackerman</em>
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  <strong>Media</strong>
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  <strong>Tweetbot:</strong> I&#8217;ve used a few Twitter apps over the years, but Tweetbot is definitely my favorite. The UI took some time to get used to, but both the desktop and mobile apps make it easy to do everything I&#8217;ve ever wanted to do with Twitter. One of the best designed and engineered apps I&#8217;ve used recently; everything just works the way I expect it to. A bit expensive, but I feel good about supporting apps of this quality. Protip: Set up <a href="https://support.twitter.com/articles/76460-how-to-use-twitter-lists">Twitter Lists</a> and follow each separately in its own column. Available for <a href="http://tapbots.com/software/tweetbot/">iPhone</a>, <a href="http://tapbots.com/software/tweetbot/ipad/">iPad</a>, and <a href="http://tapbots.com/software/tweetbot/mac/">OS X</a>. <em>Ezra Spier</em>
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  <strong>Pocket:</strong> The whole reason I have a smartphone – it lets you save the many articles that you come across on a given day (via browser, Twitter, Facebook, etc.) and then downloads them to your phone for offline reading. Available for <a href="http://getpocket.com/">iOS, OSX, and web</a>. <em>Dave Guarino</em>
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  <strong>Data</strong>
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  <strong>Open Refine (previously Google Refine):</strong> Open Refine has saved me many, many hours. It&#8217;s a deduplication and data cleaning tool that has a GUI, so it&#8217;s great for non/beginner programmers. As a warning, though, its algorithms get exponentially less fast, so it&#8217;s not great for big datasets. Available for <a href="http://openrefine.org/">Windows, OS X, and Linux</a>. <em>Rebecca Ackerman</em>
</p>

  <strong>Fun</strong>
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  <strong>Satellite Eyes:</strong> A fun little app that sets your desktop background to a map of your current location. I like using Stamen&#8217;s Watercolor tiles, but since the app is <a href="https://github.com/tomtaylor/satellite-eyes">open source</a>, <a href="https://github.com/tomtaylor/satellite-eyes/pull/22">I&#8217;m working on adding user-configurable support</a> for other tile sets like <a href="http://www.mapbox.com/">MapBox</a> and <a href="http://mapstack.stamen.com/">Map Stack</a> as well. Available for <a href="http://satelliteeyes.tomtaylor.co.uk/">OS X</a>. <em>Ezra Spier</em>
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  <strong>SleepCycle:</strong> An alarm clock that uses your phone&#8217;s accelerometer to figure out when you&#8217;re sleeping deeply – and to wake you up when you aren&#8217;t. Yes, I was skeptical about sleeping with my phone on my bed, but the app definitely makes waking up a less-jarring experience. Plus, if you&#8217;re into that whole <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantified_Self">quantified self</a> thing, you get some cool exportable data to play with. Available for <a href="http://www.sleepcycle.com/">iOS</a>. <em>Ezra Spier</em>
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  <strong>Stitcher:</strong> Because, yes, there are days when you miss <a href="http://www.kqed.org/radio/programs/forum/">KQED Forum</a>. This is your penitence. Listen to all the public radio you ever wanted, any time. Available for <a href="http://www.stitcher.com/">iOS and Android</a>. <em>Dave Guarino</em>
