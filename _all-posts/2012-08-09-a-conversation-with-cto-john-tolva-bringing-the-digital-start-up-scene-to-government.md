Code for America has had to pleasure of working closely with John this year during our partnership with the City.

We ask John how Chicago got to being at the forefront of open government and how others cities can follow suit.

&#8220;There is no reason city government can&#8217;t operate on the same principles of our hot digital sector.‚Äù

For John, Code for America represents &#8220;the agility, forward-thinkingness, and youth&#8221; that cities should be eager to learn from.

Tune-in for an exciting first-glance at how Chicago is beginning to take its cues from the digital start-up scene, and taking real steps towards innovation.
