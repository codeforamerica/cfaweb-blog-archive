There are currently 31 Code for America [Brigades](http://brigade.codeforamerica.org) in the U.S. This morning at [TEDxCity2.0](http://www.ted.com/pages/attend_tedcity2"), I announced that we&#8217;re expanding our program internationally — starting Brigades in Ireland, Japan, and Poland. These Brigades are all headed by volunteer Brigade Captains.

Since civic hacking is catching on, everywhere, we&#8217;ve made it easy for anyone, anywhere to start a Brigade — a Brigade by the numbers of sorts.

We&#8217;ve gathered and shared our collective knowledge — Code for America staff, fellows, Brigade captains — and put together guides, tools, and resources. It&#8217;s right here, <a href="http://brigade.codeforamerica.org/tools" target="_blank">http://brigade.codeforamerica.org</a>, for the using.

It&#8217;s here for passionated citizens, designers, policy wonks, data scientists, and, well, anyone, to code for their communities. These local Brigade chapters, in collaboration with their local governments, are using technology to enhance their communities — and you can too.

Join us. Find a Brigade near you [brigade.codeforamerica.org](http://brigade.codeforamerica.org/) or <a href="http://brigade.codeforamerica.org/organize" target="_blank">start one</a>.
