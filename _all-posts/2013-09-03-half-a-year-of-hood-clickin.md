  Earlier in the year, we built a game called <a href="http://click-that-hood.com/">Click That ’Hood</a> for two simple reasons: to learn the neighborhoods of Louisville (my fellowship city), and to learn some geovisualization techniques. Half a year later, with 98 cities across 12 countries, I am looking back at Click That ’Hood and realizing we have learned so much more.

  We learned how having a fun project is a perfect excuse for getting to know that technology or tool you always wanted to learn. Thanks to Click That ’Hood, I am so much more comfortable with <a href="http://d3js.org/">D3</a> and <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> today – and so are <a href="https://github.com/codeforamerica/click_that_hood/graphs/contributors">quite a few more people</a>. We also learned how to domesticate a small universe of geo formats and some tools needed to make Mr. Mercator happy. (<a href="http://cartodb.com/">CartoDB</a> has been a fantastic resource here and so was <a href="http://www.qgis.org/">QGIS</a>, helping us convert data between forgotten projections and obscure formats.)

  <span style="font-size: small; color: #cb717b;"><em>“I noticed that my home town wasn’t represented and wanted to rectify that. I noticed it was super easy to add the city myself, so I decided to just do it.”</em></span><span style="font-size: small;"><em><span style="color: #cb717b;">—Matt Keoshkerian</span>, <a style="color: #cb717b;" href="http://www.yongestreetmedia.ca/features/torontoneighbourhoodgame02272013.aspx">interview at YongeStreet</a></em></span>
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  We learned about the enormous power of lowering barriers to entry. We took our lessons and <a href="https://github.com/codeforamerica/click_that_hood/wiki/How-to-add-a-city-to-Click-That-%E2%80%99Hood">shared them publicly</a> so that others did not have to repeat our mistakes or revisit our blind alleys. Some of our wonderful contributors <a href="http://blog.line72.net/2013/02/21/birmingham-neighborhoods-on-click-that-hood/">did the same</a>. And while the first locations came from us, more and more often we would see <a href="http://www.yongestreetmedia.ca/features/torontoneighbourhoodgame02272013.aspx">strangers just sending in new data files</a>, or even ready-to-deploy code patches that included their cities.

  <span style="font-size: small; color: #cb717b;"><em>“Great to be able to share this with the city guys that gave me the data. I’m trying to use this as a bit of a lever to get them thinking about making all this data available online.”</em></span><span style="font-size: small; color: #cb717b;"><em>—@JHKennedy4, <span style="color: #cb717b;"><a style="color: #cb717b;" href="https://github.com/codeforamerica/click_that_hood/pull/58">GitHub pull request</a></span></em></span>
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  We learned how easy it sometimes is to open up data. After seeing many of our collaborators send in neighborhood files never before seen in the wild, I asked the planners <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Szczecin">of my hometown</a> to share theirs as well. I expected this to be a lengthy, arduous process… but I got the file straight away and <a href="http://click-that-hood.com/?city=szczecin">put it in the game</a> the same day.

  <span style="font-size: small; color: #cb717b;"><em>“I saw the Click That ’Hood app and thought it was really cool and then started thinking of other ways it could be used.”</em></span><span style="font-size: small; color: #cb717b;"><em>—Brendan Babb, private correspondence</em></span>
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  We learned that the simpler an idea is, the more flexible it becomes. We fought hard not to add too many bells and whistles; instead, we spent many an hour refining and polishing what we had. Later on that simplicity allowed Click That ’Hood to expand from a neighborhood game to also cover <a href="http://click-that-hood.com/?city=new-york-city-boroughs">boroughs</a>, <a href="http://click-that-hood.com/?city=basel">cantons</a>, and even <a href="http://click-that-hood.com/?city=united-states">states</a>.

  <span style="font-size: small; color: #cb717b;"><em>“I say this only half in jest, but if left to me I would have one of the upcoming mayoral debates dedicated to having all the sundry candidates play this game in real time before a live studio audience.”</em></span><span style="font-size: small; color: #cb717b;"><em>—C.

  We learned how you don’t need to know everything to build something. The day I started working on Click That ’Hood, I was still confused about which number was latitude, and which longitude. During the early days, I just cobbled together enough magic for the game to work, and then slowly kept improving it as needed – instead of waiting to figure out everything and predict all the possible outcomes before even starting.

  <span style="font-size: small; color: #cb717b;"><em>“I work at a university center for community engagement, and will share this with students. It might be a fun way for them to get oriented with the city’s neighborhoods.”</em></span><span style="font-size: small; color: #cb717b;"><em>—Bridget A. Smith, private correspondence</em></span>
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  We learned about generosity of open source and civic hacking communities. Many of the <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/fellows/">Code for America Fellows</a> contributed their knowledge and experience to our little folly project. People at <a href="http://www.mapbox.com/">MapBox</a> were incredibly helpful when we decided to switch to their mapping engine. I never heard “stupid” when asking stupid questions, and I was constantly amazed by the willingness of people donating their time to a little folly project.

  And the little folly project became something bigger. One of our contributors used Click That ’Hood to recreate the famous map of <a href="http://click-that-hood.com/?city=alaska-ipla">Indigenous Peoples and Languages of Alaska</a>. Another used the game in the class with their students. Just last month, The Knight Lab built a new project, <a href="http://knightlab.northwestern.edu/2013/07/16/introducing-neighborhood-buzz/">Neighborhood Buzz</a>, based on the neighborhood boundaries gathered in our game.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  Yet our most favorite story happened when someone in Pittsburgh wrote us about how the official neighborhood name he lived in has never been uttered by its residents. I encouraged him to look into learning GitHub and just making the change himself. Just a few hours later, I received his code change request and the same day, he was able to see his neighborhood name – Observatory Hill – on the map for the first time in decades.
</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <span style="font-size: small; color: #cb717b;"><em>“[The neighborhood being named incorrectly] has been something that has bugged many of us for decades. And finally glad to see that we are able to do something about it. I know it sounds trivial – but it really means a lot to many of us in the ’hood.”</em></span><span style="font-size: small; color: #cb717b;"><em>—Mark Masterson, private correspondence</em></span>
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  Perhaps what we really learned was what <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_and_Ray_Eames">Charles Eames</a> knew all along when he said, “Toys are not really as innocent as they look. Toys and games are preludes to serious ideas.”

  Feel free to grab the Click That ’Hood <a href="https://github.com/codeforamerica/click_that_hood">source code</a>, <a href="https://github.com/codeforamerica/click_that_hood/wiki/How-to-add-a-city-to-Click-That-%E2%80%99Hood">add a city</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/codeforamerica/click_that_hood/tree/master/public/data">play with the geo files already there</a>. Maybe you’ll decide to build something fun. Maybe some of the things we learned could be useful in your project. And we can’t wait for what next we’ll learn from you.
