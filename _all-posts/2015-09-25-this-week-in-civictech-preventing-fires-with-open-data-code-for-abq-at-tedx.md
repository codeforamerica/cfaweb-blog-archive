More than [35,000](http://www.codeforamerica.org/brigade/numbers/) people around the globe help make their communities and governments work better through the [Code for America network](http://www.codeforamerica.org/brigade/). Here&#8217;s a brief snapshot of what happened across the network this week:

### Blue Ridge Labs Announces Their Fellowship Projects

[Blue Ridge Labs](http://labs.robinhood.org/), a poverty fighting civic tech organization in NYC, announced their [five 2015 Fellowship projects](http://labs.robinhood.org/2015-fellows/). One of the projects, called [Duckling](http://labs.robinhood.org/portfolio/duckling/), provides small loans to college students using lending circles and simple loan terms through a mobile interface.

### Smoke Signals Predicts Where Smoke Alarms are Missing

[Enigma.io](http://enigma.io/)&#8216;s new project [Smoke Signals](http://labs.enigma.io/smoke-signals/), uses open data and [machine learning](https://github.com/enigma-io/smoke-signals-model) to predict which neighborhoods and buildings are most unlikely to have smoke alarms. The Red Cross has a complimentary project underway to provide and install [free smoke alarms](https://demo.getasmokealarm.org/) to the buildings identified.
