The [Code for America network](http://www.codeforamerica.org/brigade/) is made up of more than 27,000 people around the world who help make their communities and governments work better. Here&#8217;s a brief snapshot of what happened across the network this week:

### Love letters for trees in Melbourne

[Melbourne assigned trees email addresses](http://www.citylab.com/tech/2015/07/when-you-give-a-tree-an-email-address/398219/) so citizens could report problems. Instead, people wrote thousands of love letters to their favorite trees.

### Introducing Code for Philly’s new leadership team

<span style="color: #252525;">As the Code for America volunteer Brigades grow larger and start attracting lots of volunteers, we&#8217;ve seen their volunteer leaders increase in sophistication to match. Code for Philly just built out their team to better serve Philadelphia’s civic hacking community. <a href="http://technical.ly/philly/2015/07/10/code-for-philly-leadership-dawn-mcdougall/">Meet the new Code for Philly leadership team</a> including Dawn McDougall<span style="font-weight: 600;">, </span>the group’s first executive director.</span>

### #Helpwanted: Angular and JavaScript at Code for Kansas City

### PennApps, the largest hackathon in America, adds a civic tech category

PenApps is getting offering unique prizes for different routes, starting this fall. One of these new routes is for [Social and Government Impact](http://2015f.pennapps.com/#learn). PennApps offers free travel for college students across the world.

### 67 million more Federal Election Commission records at your fingertips

18F  [released](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/07/15/openfec-api-update/) the [FEC Campaign Finance API](https://api.open.fec.gov/developers). This is the first major update to the API, but the OpenFEC API is part of a larger project that will have continual improvements and additions. The records 18F allow you to see in detail where a campaign’s money comes from and where they spend their money.

    Most profound compliment you can make of an <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/opendata?src=hash">#opendata</a> API is to build something with it. Let&#8217;s get cracking folks. <a href="https://t.co/TGKTglprLj">https://t.co/TGKTglprLj</a>

### [Putting the public into public media membership](#publicmedia) {#publicmedia}

 [A study](http://www.niemanlab.org/2015/07/putting-the-public-into-public-media-membership/) by 18F’s Melody Kramer includes nods to Code for America and Code for America Brigades. We helped set up a prototype of the [Code for America&#8217;s Issue Finder](http://www.codeforamerica.org/geeks/civicissues) to create a way for public radio stations to show any open source projects they have and how the public could help.

Past weekly updates can be found at [#civictech](http://www.codeforamerica.org/blog/tag/civictech/) or in [slide form](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1REVYDSRU0CBhtmgOTDRb2CJJHkyA-Lfo6mtZas6X8kc/edit?usp=sharing) for your hacknights.
