_MuniRent is part of the 2014 Accelerator Class at Code for America. Founded by Alan Mond and Julien Vanier, MuniRent is a platform that simplifies the process for local governments to rent heavy-duty equipment to other local governments, with a vision of bringing the sharing economy to all levels of government._

**How We Started**

The first time I hosted a guest through Airbnb, the short term accommodation website, two things popped in my mind: a) what to do with the extra $200 and b) what else could I rent out that is not fully utilized?

Since then, I became enthralled by the idea of the sharing economy and felt the urge to start a company in this space. I recruited my friend and co-founder, Julien Vanier, who immediately jumped on board and we got to work.

The key was finding examples of heavily underutilized assets that were in high demand. After researching different potential markets, we were discouraged by major obstacles.

One day in Ann Arbor, a city dump truck drove in front of us towing an enormous yellow excavator. When I turned to Julien with an excited look on my face, he probably knew what I was going to say next: &#8220;What about municipalities?&#8221;

This is how <a href="https://www.munirent.co/" target="_blank">MuniRent</a> started. Our goal is to enable local governments to rent underutilized equipment to and from each other. We want to bring a new version of the sharing economy to government. We call it collaborative government.

What we&#8217;ve found from researching and embedding ourselves in the world of local government are pockets of very smart people who understood the value of collaboration. They are willing to share underutilized resources, but are unfortunately bogged down by administrative red tape and clumsy software.

**Why Are We Coding for America?**

We are coding for America to help local governments unleash the potential of the sharing economy for the benefit of their communities. There is a strong trend towards collaborative government and we are proud to be part of this movement. MuniRent is connecting governments in an equipment marketplace under a vetted legal framework and an intuitive user interface.

John Adams, finance director and treasurer for the city of Thousand Oaks, CA <a title="Next “Sharing Economy” Step: Backhoes on Loan" href="http://nextcity.org/daily/entry/sharing-economy-city-equipment-munirent" target="_blank">said it best</a>: “We’re always looking for ways to collaborate and do things more cost-effectively for the taxpayer. We have that fiduciary responsibility. That’s why the idea of MuniRent is appealing and unique.”

Thought leaders within government around the country are working hard to make Collaborative Government a reality and we&#8217;d like to support them with our technology. The MuniRent transaction engine will empower these game changing individuals within government to reduce inefficiencies and increase services they can deliver to all of us.
