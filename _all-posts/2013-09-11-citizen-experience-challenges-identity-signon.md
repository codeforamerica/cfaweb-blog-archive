_This is the first in a series of posts about major challenges for the experience of city residents in interacting with their government._

Here is a very simple and vexing question, without a simple solution: why should a city resident who has a registered residence or vehicle have to complete separate, full, square one applications for a transit card, a library card, a parks and recreation class, a business, a street tree, to vote, etc.? And how can we, as civic designers and technologists, lighten this burden for people?

It doesn’t really matter which registration you start with – most city departments collect information in separate systems and require people interacting with them to re-enter all of their personal information. Name, address, age, family members – all of it. Sometimes, a person is even required to get a paper copy of a document from one city department to prove to another that he or she is eligible for a service. My (un)favorite example occurred when I needed to take a paper copy of my daughter’s birth certificate (in the city where she was born) to the transit agency to get her a youth transit pass, even though I had recently registered her for public school and had shown the same birth certificate (still in the city in which it was issued) as proof of her age. Similar disconnects affect city residents tens of thousands of times every day.

While I understand how this situation came to be, and I’m aware of the obstacles to a quick fix, I’m interested in exploring the ideal. I think it’s important to talk explicitly about where we want to take the experience of being governed, even if getting there will be a long road.

How else could this work? We have some interesting potential examples from the commercial world. The web has developed a number of signon-proxy and similar services in recent years as &#8220;signup fatigue&#8221; has become a problem – they include Facebook Connect, PayPal Checkout, Google Checkout, Twitter API, etc., leaving out programs such as LastPass that are more directed at security than reducing registration pain. These are far from perfect experiences and they come with nontrivial privacy concerns, but they’re thriving because they make things easier for both end users and developers. Imagine a world where we had a well-designed municipal implementation of these ideas:

If my city has information about me in one of its systems, it’s available to me or anyone acting for me in another system. So if I have a library card and I want to register for a karate class at my local community center, the system should be able to retrieve my address and present it to me for correction. Then it should ask me for additional information needed, like my phone number and current belt level. If I’ve paid a city event fee recently, perhaps the system even has my credit card information on file so I don’t have to either re-key it or tell it number by number to the person on the phone at Parks and Recreation. Or if this class registration is the first time I enter it, I’ll be offered the option to save that information, and if I do, then next week when I need to pay a parking ticket, I’ll be able to use that saved information if I choose. If I decide to register a home-based business, that same information from my library card record should be my starting point once again. Once I’ve done that, if I want to apply for a small business assistance program, much of the information I need should be already available, making the process much simpler for me, and much harder to introduce error into – and the official calling me for an interview can use the phone number I entered for the karate class (unless I want to give a different one).

I could go on. In one paragraph I’ve mentioned six departments that would need to change their systems and processes to make this a reality. That’s daunting. But I think it’s worse if we just accept this as the way things have to be. Imagining an ideal gives us a direction to go, and then we can begin to design the first step.
