This week, we hosted a [webinar](http://codeforamerica.org/2011-webinar/) to discuss our plans for the 2011 projects and how you can get involved. We were thrilled to see the great turnout, as well as the lively conversation happening on [twitter](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23cfa2011). (For example, _[@govnerdgrrl:](http://twitter.com/Govnerdgrrl/statuses/4646273328091136) &#8220;Code for America webinar just talked about a Foursquare type app built on&#8230;John Adams&#8217; history tour&#8230;so cool.&#8221;_ and _[@TeamPA](http://twitter.com/TeamPA):&#8221;Now you&#8217;re talking our language&#8230;Talking improving speed and transparency of small business permit processes through technology&#8221;_.) Plus, we had a guest appearance from Tim O&#8217;Reilly who offered his insights into the need for Gov 2.0 on the local level.

For those of you who couldn&#8217;t make it, we&#8217;ve posted the [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkvcH-cD92M&#038;feature=player_embedded) of the presentation and the [slide deck](http://www.slideshare.net/codeforamerica/cfa-web-deck-5803846) online, and both are available below.
