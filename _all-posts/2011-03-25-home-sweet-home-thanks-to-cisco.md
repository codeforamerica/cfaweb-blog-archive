<img class="alignright" src="http://codeforamerica.org/img/crushed.jpg" alt="" width="250px" />It’s hard to believe, but it’s been 3 months since we moved into our space in downtown San Francisco at Second & Mission. The first few weeks were a bit hectic (see for yourself, right) as we moved in on December 23 with less than 2 weeks before our fellows started on January 5. Hectic indeed. We were pretty much only able to unpack and set up a few chairs before our fellows walked through the door to start the intensive [CfA Training](http://codeforamerica.org/the-2011-cfa-institute/). During the month of February, our fellows were dispersed in their cities conducting hundreds of interviews, so we had the opportunity to continue the move-in into our space and make it more our own&#8230; trust me, I had no idea how long of a process it would be! The fellows returned to the office in early March, and it really felt as if we were welcoming them home.

Shelter is one of life’s core necessities. How do you go about thanking someone for providing that to you? I’m not really sure you can, but I’m going to try. Cisco has very generously donated the space @ Second & Mission, that we now call home, to Code for America. As a young non-profit, this is beyond huge. I toured dozens and dozens of offices in the Bay Area to try and find suitable space for our organization. Without breaking the bank, it simply wasn’t possible.

It started with an email to [Padmasree Warrior](http://newsroom.cisco.com/dlls/execs/warrior-padmasree.html), Cisco’s CTO, in August inquiring about possible space that Cisco may have available to donate. That started the wheels in motion. When we toured the potential space it was hard to hide our enthusiasm. It was perfect. Plenty of co-working space, a room for lectures and large meetings, a kitchen, and built-in desks to accommodate all fellows and staff&#8230;did I mention that the desks all have windows?!?

It&#8217;s both a beautiful and inspiring space. It was previously occupied by Moto, a firm chuck full of great designers and innovators who were responsible for the Flip and other cool projects. Cisco recognized their abundance of talent and snapped them up. Their legacy in the space is evident, for which we&#8217;re very thankful.

However, going from the idea of using the space to the reality of moving in wasn’t easy. And it never would have happened without Suzanne Cooper at Cisco who worked around the clock leading up to the holidays to make sure we got access to our space in time to prepare for our fellows starting. Her persistence and patient prodding throughout the process is the only reason I’m sitting here, in this space, writing this blog post. Of course, there were lots of people who helped this along including Pat Moore, Damien Hawcroft (who continued to help us even while on holiday in Australia), Jim Wrich, Jim Dublin, Katie Tomason and Frank Stearns. Code for America thanks Cisco and everyone on Cisco&#8217;s team who made this donation possible!
