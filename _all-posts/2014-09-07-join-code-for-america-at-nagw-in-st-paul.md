  <a href="https://nagw.org/conference/2014/schedule/sessions/neighbors-online-engaging-government-community-inclusion" target="_blank"><strong>Steve Clift: Neighbors Online &#8211; Engaging Government to Community Inclusion</strong></a><br /> Code for America Brigade member and executive director and founder of E-Democracy.org, Steve Clift will talk about strategies and tools to connect neighbors online to foster inclusive community engagement. Whether it&#8217;s using Facebook Groups to respond to Hurricane Sandy, parents networks, or the over 1,000 households in just one Minneapolis neighborhood, connecting in community life unleashes exciting opportunities for local communities and public services. Steve will run through E-Democracy&#8217;s top ten list of how 20,000+ neighbors are connecting online (based on their BeNeighbors.org project in the Twin Cities), along with unique insights into different tools (Facebook Groups, NextDoor, i-Neighbors, and more) and E-democracy&#8217;s engagement with government.<br /> <em><strong>Session time:</strong></em> Wednesday, September 10, 2014, 11:00 a.m. to 12:15 p.m., CDT<br /> <em><strong>Venue:</strong></em> Governors 3

  <a href="https://nagw.org/conference/2014/schedule/sessions/digital-front-door" target="_blank"><strong>Cyd Harrell and Michal Migurski: The Digital Front Door</strong><br /> </a>Everyone hates their own website. Municipal government websites have historically been *about* the government, and it&#8217;s time for them to *be* the government, doing the people&#8217;s business online. Code for America is undertaking a pilot project to make this transition possible for every city by redesigning the website redesign. The Digital Front Door project is a collection of research, proofs of concept, and key tools that allow government websites to truly engage with residents’ needs.<br /> <em><strong>Session time: </strong></em> Thursday, September 11, 2014, 11:00 a.m. to 12:15 p.m., CDT<br /> <em><strong>Venue:</strong></em> Kellogg I

  <a href="https://nagw.org/conference/2014/schedule/sessions/just-text-me-mobile-communications-government-and-you" target="_blank"><strong>Just Text Me: Mobile Communications, Government, and You<br /> </strong></a>Who says you can’t have government in your pocket? This talk will go over case studies of government meeting citizens on their phones. Texting for crowd-sourced input or simple timely notifications of everything from transit delays to renewing food stamps. Smarter call centers. MMS for potholes. We’ll go over some of the simplest solutions that are saving government resources, and people time.<br /> <em><strong>Session time:</strong></em> Thursday, September 11, 2014, 3:15 p.m. to 4:30 p.m., CDT<br /> <em><strong>Venue:</strong></em> Governors 4

  <a href="https://nagw.org/conference/2014/schedule/sessions/civic-technology-front-lines" target="_blank"><strong>Christopher Whitaker: Civic Technology on the Front Lines<br /> </strong></a>While civic hacking has become more mainstream, there are not nearly enough apps that focus on the day to day work of government. This session is about using civic user testing and user centric design to bring the focus back on doing real work.<br /> <em><strong>Session time:</strong></em> Thursday, September 11, 2014, <span class="date-display-start">3:15 p.m.</span> to <span class="date-display-end">4:30 p.m.</span>, CDT<br /> <em><strong>Venue:</strong></em> State II and III
