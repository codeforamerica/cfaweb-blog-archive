The phrase &#8220;fixing government&#8221; brings a lot of baggage along with it for anywhere as pluralistic as America. Old dividing questions are invariably dredged up: smaller government, or more services? Security or freedom? Boxers or briefs? Americans expect a great deal from their elected officials, and many of the problems they are supposed to be fixing are complicated by diverging factors, our fickle electorate being not among the least of them.

So the American citizenship can&#8217;t agree about what the government should do with our money and their time. But I think we can universally agree that our democracy benefits from stronger lines of communication, whether between the government and their constituents, among citizens themselves, or between government officials. I believe that we can drastically improve the functioning of government through better systems of information. And I want to be part of the movement to change the way government and citizens communicate. Code for America was looking to help lead this movement. So I wanted in.

It gets better. There are a lot a laudable organizations attempting to fix various aspects of our government, but few (if any of them) have a model in which so much positive progress can be made by so few people, with relatively low levels of capital. Code for America doesn&#8217;t seek to be a cure all, but wants to leverage existing lightweight and open technology to make government more accessible, responsible, and transparent, to the benefit of everyone.

Certain forms of information has never been so easy to obtain and convey as it is today, thanks largely to the rise in the collaborative internet. Americans, companies, and communities post tomes of information about themselves, their social connections, and their whereabouts online, through online networks. They also share content, coalesce around interests, and share opinions.

But this increased communication hasn&#8217;t drastically changed the way in which the government and the citizenship share information and interact. Code for America believes there are huge gains in government efficiency and response to be made if we can harness the power of the collaborative web to improve government. The task is to identify areas where open source, collaborative technology platforms can improve communication between government and citizen. This could be anything from improving 311 services, to creating a space for citizens to share open source solutions, to creating a way for citizens to create community groups and communicate about the issues that most directly affect them.

So how can this be brought about? By applying the principles, skills, and energy that govern our ridiculously innovative internet and tech companies to civic problems. By treating cities like start ups. By pooling information, building upon solutions that have already been created and tested, and by reaching out to others who have expertise. In other words, by treating government problems in an agile and collaborative manner, and through the use of technology that will engage citizens and foster community.

Of course, there is a selfish element to my interest in Code for America, which offers an unparalleled opportunity to gain tremendous experience working at the intersection of business and technology. CFA offers its fellows the chance to work with tremendous talent, and to cultivate skills that will inform the rest of their careers, wherever they go.

But most importantly to me, CFA offers me the opportunity to enact meaningful change for a community. Getting to use your energy, intelligence, and experience to make American cities work better is something I would fight for: Code for America offers exactly that. So I want in.
