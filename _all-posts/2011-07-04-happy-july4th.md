Hereâ€™s to you, [Betsy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betsy_Ross)&#8230;[<img src="http://codeforamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/flag-thumb.png" alt="" title="flag-thumb" class="alignright size-full wp-image-7238" />](http://flag.codeforamerica.org)

The US flag symbolizes both diversity and unity: 13 original colonies, 50 states, 1 USA. At Code for America, we wanted to honor the flag and the diversity it represents using the technology we love. So, we created a site to do just that: <http://flag.codeforamerica.org>

The site aggregates Twitter avatars from users who [tweet about #July4](http://twitter.com/share?url=http://flag.codeforamerica.org&#038;related=codeforamerica&#038;text=Show+your+tweets+and+stripes+on+the+%40codeforamerica+%23july4th+flag%21) and beautifully mashes them up into a mosaic representation of the stars and stripes&#8211;again representing the diversity and unity of the original flag. This is a flag everyone can be a part of &#8212; a 21st Century &#8220;Old Glory.&#8221; 

Many thanks to Quodis and the Mozilla Foundation who built the core tech running the site &#8212; and fittingly made it reusable.tOt was great to work with a number of members from the CfA team &#8212; [Abhi Nemani](http://codeforamerica.org/author/abhi), [fellow Karla Macedo](http://codeforamerica.org/author/karla) and [interns](http://codeforamerica.org/2011-cfa-summer-interns/) Ronaldo Barchacho, Aditya Pai, and Tim Yoon &#8212; to get it up and redesign it, red, white, and blue.

[Check out the site](http://flag.codeforamerica.org), [tweet it out](http://twitter.com/share?url=http://flag.codeforamerica.org&#038;related=codeforamerica&#038;text=Show+your+tweets+and+stripes+on+the+%40codeforamerica+%23july4th+flag%21) to show some pride, but most importantly, enjoy the Fourth.
