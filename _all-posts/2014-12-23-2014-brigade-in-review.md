It&#8217;s hard to believe 2014 is nearly over. It was an amazing year for the Brigade network as a whole, as well as for individual chapters all around the world. As the year wraps up, we wanted to take time to celebrate this year&#8217;s wins and reflect on what we did together as a network.

Before we do so, however, we wanted to stop and say thank you. Thank you to the hundreds of Brigade leaders, thousands of volunteers, and hundreds of local government and community partners who dedicated their time, skills, and passion to make their communities stronger. These accomplishments are yours.

### What We Did Together

2014 was a huge year for growth in the Brigade. Over the year, the Brigade Network grew to:

  * [137 Brigades](http://www.codeforamerica.org/brigade/) (up from 34 Brigades in 2013)
  * [15,000+ members](http://code-for-america-brigade.meetup.com/) registered via Meetup (up from 5,720 in 2013)

To support this growth, the Brigade program focused on building an infrastructure to allow the network to scale smarter and stronger. This infrastructure included: rolling out core leadership teams, defining a simplified support structure, piloting a regional program, and building the CFAPI.

**Core Leadership Teams**

In 2014, the Brigade network was focused on making Brigades more sustainable by building out local chapters&#8217; leadership from one or two Captains to a [core team of leaders](https://docs.google.com/a/codeforamerica.org/document/d/1oEB1CuzCHldxP_bzcvmcrmK0yAE1BzV2AGhtwtYKZVY/edit). Building out a core leadership team was (and is) important for the long-term sustainability of a Brigade because it makes a chapter less-personality driven and more resilient to leadership turnover. To support Brigades in this work, Code for America provided programming and training for core team member roles including Captains, Storytellers, Delivery Leads, and Community Organizers.  The current count of core team members across the network includes:

  * 92 Captains
  * 30 Storytellers
  * 24 Community Organizers
  * 30 Delivery Leads

**Simplified Support Structure: 4Ps**

As more and more groups joined the Brigade network, the question of what Brigades need to do to be successful became increasingly frequent. To answer this question, we researched successes and failures of Brigades around the world and identified four key characteristics of successful Brigades, which we call the 4Ps. The [4Ps include: people, partnerships, plans, and participation](http://www.codeforamerica.org/brigade/organize).

Simply put, if a group is organizing people in a respectful and thoughtful way; executing on a strategic plan aligned with the [Code for America Principles](http://www.codeforamerica.org/governments/principles/); engaging local government and community groups in partnerships; and learning and sharing with the Code for America Brigade network, we believe that they will be successful in driving the change they want to see in their community. In 2015, the 4Ps will guide the [support](http://www.codeforamerica.org/brigade/organize) we offer to Brigades.

**Regional Pilot**
  
In July 2014, the Brigade started a six month regional pilot in the Midwest, headquartered in Chicago and led by [Christopher Whitaker](http://www.codeforamerica.org/blog/2014/12/19/what-i-learned-from-the-midwest-regional-brigade-pilot/). The pilot&#8217;s goals were to provide deeper support for Code for America Brigade cities in the region, as well as support for new Brigades getting started. The regional pilot helped jumpstart new Brigades in Cleveland and Rockford. The pilot also allowed for deeper engagement with existing Brigades in Nebraska, Detroit, and several other cities. In 2015, we&#8217;ll explore how other regions in the United States could benefit from similar support.

**CFAPI**
  
A network is only as valuable as the people who participate and contribute to it. To make it easier for Brigade members to contribute to the network and see what each other are up to, [Andrew Hyder](http://www.codeforamerica.org/people/andrew-hyder/), Code for America&#8217;s <span style="color: #222222;">Developer Relations Engineer, built the <a href="https://github.com/codeforamerica/cfapi#readme">CFAPI</a>. The CFAPI tracks projects, stories, and events for every Brigade chapter around the world. It powers the <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/brigade/">Code for America Brigade website</a>, where you can easily locate Brigade chapters and checkout what they&#8217;re doing.</span>

These events brought together 2,484 participants (up from 780 in 2013). The impact of the day was huge, as Code for Asheville noted, &#8220;CodeAcross helped bolster Code for Asheville&#8217;s credibility and professionalism in collaborating with the City of Asheville. Our elected officials realized that they have a Brigade of talented volunteers ready to lead the charge in citizen-government collaboration.”
