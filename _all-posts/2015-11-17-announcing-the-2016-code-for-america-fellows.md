Today I’m excited to announce our [2016 Code for America Fellowship class](http://www.codeforamerica.org/geeks/our-geeks/2016-fellows/). These 18 passionate individuals will serve [six communities](https://www.codeforamerica.org/governments/2016-announcement/) across the country to develop digital approaches to delivering public services that:

  * improve access to health and human services in the Kansas City, Missouri and the New York City, New York,
  * safely reduce incarceration in Salt Lake County, Utah and the Seattle, Washington, and
  * promote economic development opportunities in the New Orleans, Louisiana and the Long Beach, California.

Over the last five years, Code for America has seen 126 fellows pass through its doors and we’re excited to add to the 2016 class to our growing network. The 2016 fellows bring a variety of experience to Code for America as they leave their jobs at tech companies, their own businesses, and within government to use their skills to make government services simpler, faster, and more effective for the people who use them.

The [18 fellows](http://www.codeforamerica.org/geeks/our-geeks/2016-fellows/) who make up the 2016 class include developers, designers, researchers, project and product managers, university lecturers, urban planners, and community organizers. They have worked for organizations such as Google, Microsoft, Buzzfeed, Thoughtbot, General Assembly, Salesforce, AmeriCorps, and USAID. They’ve been teachers at George Washington University, Rutgers University, and BAYCAT. They’ve worked with government, spanning from the U.S. Department of Interior to the City of Dallas. They are active members of their communities and make their cities better by volunteering with Women Who Code and the San Francisco and DC Code for America Brigades

This class of fellows will work with the [2016 Fellowship government partners](https://www.codeforamerica.org/governments/2016-announcement/): Kansas City, Missouri; Long Beach, California; New Orleans, Louisiana; New York City, New York; Salt Lake County, Utah; and Seattle, Washington.
