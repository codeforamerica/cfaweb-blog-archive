Code for America is pleased to welcome [Lauren Dyson](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/lauren-dyson/a/2ab/3) as its newest employee. Lauren joins Code for America as the Community Coordinator for our Civic Commons project.

Lauren isn&#8217;t new to Code for America, having previously served as a communications intern in 2011, and we&#8217;re thrilled to have her back to help develop the community around the Commons.

[Civic Commons](http://civiccommons.org/) is central to the core mission of Code for America &#8211; helping cities work smarter and more efficiently by leveraging the power of the web. The Civic Commons Marketplace and [Wiki](http://wiki.civiccommons.org/) provide an invaluable resource to governments to share &#8220;what&#8217;s working, where&#8221; from both the software and policy worlds. The continued development of the community around Civic Commons will be a critical element to its success.

Lauren is a Vassar graduate with experience as an analyst for the Berkman Center for the Internet, and the Congressional Internet Caucus. Her experience and skills will be a huge asset to Code for America on the Civic Commons project.

Please join us in welcoming Lauren to her new position!
