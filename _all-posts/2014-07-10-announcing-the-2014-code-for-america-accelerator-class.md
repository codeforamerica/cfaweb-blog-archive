We&#8217;re excited to announce the [2014 Code for America Accelerator class.](http://codeforamerica.org/geeks/our-startups/) It was a tough selection process &#8212; with strong applications from more than 112 companies. Ultimately, we decided on five key companies.

**The 2014 class of the CfA Accelerator includes:**

<a href="http://www.amigocloud.com/" target="_blank">AmigoCloud</a> (San Francisco, Calif.): Founded by Ragi Burhum and Victor Chernetsky, AmigoCloud is a next-generation mapping technology company, providing mobile Geographic Information System (GIS) solutions with advanced offline support. Available on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.amigocloud.amigomobile" target="_blank">Android</a> and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/amigocloud/id859828186?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a> devices, AmigoCloud makes geospatial data collection, administration, and sharing simple and is currently used by nearly 100 organizations.

  <a href="http://www.munirent.co/" target="_blank">MuniRent</a> (Ann Arbor, Mich.): Founded by Alan Mond and Julien Vanier, MuniRent is a platform that simplifies the process for local governments to rent heavy duty equipment to other local governments, with a vision to bring the sharing economy to all levels of government. Through MuniRent, local governments can seamlessly rent equipment to and from other municipalities, road commissions, school districts, and counties at rates much lower than commercial rental companies.  Municipalities with underutilized equipment can offset maintenance costs and generate revenue using MuniRent.

Aggregating information from trusted sources of supply chain sustainability data, ProductBio can automatically figure out what matters by product category, how things were made by suppliers, and how an organization&#8217;s purchases measure up. Cities and schools are currently using this product meta-data, evaluation, and reporting to save time and money when complying with government administrative regulations.

The pair also founded Transit & Trails, which connects people to parks and open spaces, in partnership with Bay Area Open Space Council, a coalition of most of the park agencies in the San Francisco Bay Area.

  The Code for America Accelerator is a four-month program (July through October), with support from Google for Entrepreneurs, the Passport Foundation, and the Ron Conway Family Foundation, and advisors Tim O’Reilly and Ron Bouganim. The Accelerator, now in it&#8217;s third year, provides the startups with funding of $25,000, training and mentorship, and access to Code for America’s extensive government network to navigate the government technology ecosystem. Accelerator companies also present at the <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/summit">Code for America Summit</a> in September, an annual gathering of more than 800 civic technology leaders, ranging from Mayors to entrepreneurs,  community organizers to CTOs, from over 80 cities.
