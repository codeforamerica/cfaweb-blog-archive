We were thrilled to see the response to our open call for city applications. We had over nearly two dozen governments apply to our program; all of them were strong candidates, so it made our job of selecting the most promising partners a difficult one.

City applicants were asked to identify problems in their city that our team of geeks could solve using light weight creative technology. As you can imagine, the problems were compelling and in most cases common among multiple cities. For example, in Detroit data on vacant properties is currently siloâ€™ed and unorganized, so the city lacks a clear picture of available real estate, which undercuts future residential and commercial development. A number of other city applicants are interested in implementing [Open311](http://open311.org) in their cities and evolving customer service to include residents as resources in addressing their local issues. During the past four months Code for America staff, fellows and an [amazing selection committee](http://codeforamerica.org/2011/03/21/2012-gov-selection-cmte/ "Selection Committee") reviewed, rated, and evaluated the applications and narrowed down potential partners to a group of 10 finalists. 

We&#8217;re pleased today to announce the list of finalists, and share details about their proposed projects. Please follow the links below to learn more about what each city is hoping to accomplish in CfA 2012:

This group will be narrowed down to five to eight city partners for our 2012 program. Final selections will be made based on the strength of leadership that can maneuver through or overcome bureaucratic obstacles, the availability of funding to support the project, and the ability for the solution to make an impact locally and to be shared nationally. We&#8217;ll be announcing selected cities later this year.
