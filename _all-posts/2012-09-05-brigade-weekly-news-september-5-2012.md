Our weekly report on what civic hackers and open gov advocates are doing, saying, and sharing:

## 1. [OpenOakland Brigade tries to unite techies, community advocates, and city hall](http://www.insidebayarea.com/news/ci_21464979/openoakland-brigade-tries-unite-techies-community-advocates-and "inside bay area article")

Angela Woodall of the Oakland Tribune reported to residents there on her impressions of [Open Oakland](http://openoakland.org/ "home page")&#8216;s inaugural meeting and on the Brigade, in general.

## 2. <a href="http://www.rapidgrowthmedia.com/dogood/08_23_12_Friendly_Corps.aspx" target="_blank" data-bitly-type="bitly_hover_card">Making Grand Rapids friendlier</a>

Rapid Growth Media shared a peek into Grand Rapids brigade, [Friendly Code](http://friendlycode.org/ "home page"). Friendly Code is the tech counterpart to Friendly Corps, a group of urbanists, and physical infrastructure enthusiasts.

## 3. <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/codeforamerica.org/forum/?hl=en&fromgroups=#!topic/pittsburgh-brigade/rJVqi_H5-w8" target="_blank" data-bitly-type="bitly_hover_card">Itching for City of Pittsburgh Data? Contact me</a>

We caught this sweet post on Code for Pittsburgh forum. It&#8217;s local government inviting the brigade to start a dialog with the city about open data. Sounds like a good topic for some Brigade meetups or maybe a [CityCamp](http://citycamp.govfresh.com "home page").

## 4. <a href="http://opensource.com/government/12/8/citizens-empowered-by-open-government" target="_blank" data-bitly-type="bitly_hover_card">A time for change: Citizens empowered by open government </a>

This is a good lightning talk by Jason Hibbets of [opensource.com](http://opensource.com "home page") about his passion for open source and its connection with open government.

## 5. <a href="http://www.heraldextra.com/news/local/north/cedar-hills/zappala-ready-to-represent-city-on-cedar-hills-council/article_dd042737-28ab-5dc7-9c11-14608ceb3196.html" target="_blank" data-bitly-type="bitly_hover_card">Zappala ready to represent city on Cedar Hills council</a>

The Daily Herald (Utah) reported that BYU computer science professor and newest Cedar Hills council member Daniel Zappala wants to bring Code for America to his city. Salt Lake City was recently the second city to launch [Textizen](http://www.textizen.com/welcome "home page").

## 6. <a href="http://applicationsforgood.org/blog/challenging-all-developers-and-designers/" target="_blank" data-bitly-type="bitly_hover_card">Challenging all developers and designers &#8211; Code for Change</a>

Code for America is partnered with [NYU Wagner Graduate School of Public Service](http://wagner.nyu.edu "home page") and others to develop technical challenges richly informed by NYC gov and not-for-profits through a competition called Code for Change. The competition was recently opened to technologists to form teams and win challenges.
