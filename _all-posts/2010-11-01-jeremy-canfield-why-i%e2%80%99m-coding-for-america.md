Like Justice Brandeis, I believe that Sunlight is the best disinfectant and that coders and designers are a tremendous resource for letting that light into government processes while at the same time making it leaner, friendlier, and more efficient. And while I believe that technology has the power to make government at all levels more responsive, it can not do so without understanding citizens needs, and the processes by which public servants attempt to fill them. My experience with my start-ups, course projects and even in some cases, government service has demonstrated the tremendous potential of small creative teams to tackle big problems, and do so quickly. I flourish in such environments, and love that I am able to put my skills and experiences to use to the benefit of my country.
