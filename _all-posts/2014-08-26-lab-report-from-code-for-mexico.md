It’s been almost a year since we started the <a title="Code for Mexico City Fellowship Program" href="http://labplc.mx/complices/" target="_blank">Code for Mexico City Fellowship program</a>. As the coordinator of the program I couldn’t be happier with the results from the first generation: we now have a number of civic apps made with government open data in collaboration with the city and community. But at the beginning we didn’t even know if there were people interested in working with the government on civic hacking for Mexico City. It was an uncommon situation within Mexico, to be honest: a government department calling on citizens to work with different government partners to develop apps for the city with a citizen focus.

The first open call for people to apply for the Code for Mexico City Fellowship program was amazingly successful; we had 150 applicants to choose from. The selection process was tough, but we were pleased to see that we had so many people interested in improving their city using technology. In the end we chose five fellows to work with five government departments: Environment, Health, Tourism, Transportation, and Economic Development.

We soon realized that the government partners were just as eager as the Fellows to use technology to solve city issues, they just didn’t know how. For one month the Fellows learned everything they could about the way each department works. They interviewed city residents, talked to their counterparts in government, and found common ground between government goals and citizen needs.

With some insight into how government operates and their first rough sketches for project ideas, the Fellows set out to open the data that would make it possible for them to develop a working demo. To that end, they built <a title="Code for Mexico City's DataLab" href="http://datos.labplc.mx" target="_blank">DataLab</a> – a government open data repository that contains 27 different data sets and 10 government APIs, which were used for the first civic hackathon in Mexico City and now serves as a source of data for the Fellows’ own projects.

Getting these datasets turned out to be the easy part. What was harder than we expected was making user-friendly apps. There were too many features which required more data than we had available to us, and these requirements would have made the projects too complex to develop in the nine month duration of the Fellowship. So the next goal was to scale down and keep the apps as simple and useful as possible. To achieve this, we had to go to the users. For example, after user research, we decided to use an “old technology” for the Economic Development project: telephone landlines.

After nine months, the Fellows developed six different projects, ranging from a dashboard to encourage healthy activities amongst citizens, to an app that makes riding in taxis safer, to the creation of standards for the way events in the city are captured, to opening data about environmental policies that hadn’t been available before.

At its core, Code for Mexico City is not all about the data or the technology. We learned that the real challenge is social. Whether it’s changing an official’s mind on why opening data is a good idea or convincing them to adopt new digital tools, it’s about showing those with whom you work with that together, it’s possible to find new and innovative ways of addressing issues in your community by bringing together people with different skills and perspectives. We now have a group of allies in government who serve as amplifiers for what we started as they have allies in civic-minded citizens.

The next step will be making these pieces of technology more useful for citizens. We want people to use the apps, but we also want the community to get involved, <a title="Code for Mexico City's Github repos" href="https://github.com/LabPLC" target="_blank">fork our repos</a>, see what we’ve done and improve upon it, ask for more data, give feedback, and really make it their own. What we want is to make government a platform, and for these projects to truly be for the people and by the people.
