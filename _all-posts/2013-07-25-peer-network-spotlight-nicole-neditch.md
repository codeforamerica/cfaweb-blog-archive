    Nicole Neditch (<a href="https://twitter.com/nneditch">@nneditch</a>) is the Online Engagement Manager for the City of Oakland. Nicole has been a key player in making Oakland a leading city in the civic hacking movement. She&#8217;s driving collaboration with community groups like <a href="http://openoakland.org/">OpenOakland</a> that bring together city staff, technologists, and journalists to work together to make Oakland a better place to live. Projects emerging from these efforts, like <a href="http://answers.oaklandnet.com/">Oakland Answers</a>, have drawn national attention, including a recent mention in <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/columnist/2013/06/23/baverman-columnist-entrepreneurs-startups/2445807/">USA Today</a>. We asked her a few questions:

  How did you come to work in local government (the postcard length version)?
</h2>

Before I worked for the City of Oakland, I owned a coffee shop and an art gallery. As a small business owner, I had to interact with local government entities often. Paper processes, siloed departments, and inconsistent response left me frustrated constantly.

Wanting to make a difference, I started attending public meetings, voicing my concerns, and building relationships with people in my community. I joined coalitions dedicated to keeping dollars local, preserving arts funding and promoting small businesses. I sat on the City’s arts commission so that I could have a direct impact on City government and its relationship to the arts. And, ultimately, I forged partnerships with some amazing City staff who have since provided countless hours of support and mentorship to me. As the walls of the bureaucracy started to unfold, I realized how much opportunity there was in local government to really have an impact on people’s everyday lives, and I wanted to be part of that.

## You&#8217;ve been deeply involved in developing the civic hacking community in Oakland. What&#8217;s your advice for other city staff seeking to build strong working relationships with the local developer community?

Participate! Attend meetups, hack nights, and hackathons. Contribute your knowledge of government and our bureaucratic systems, and act as a resource whenever needed. Forge relationships with your local civic hackers and help connect them with people, resources and data within City Hall. Help ensure that the tools that are developed are reflective of the needs of both your community and City staff. Your City’s civic hacking community will flourish if they view their City government as a true partner that provides resources and support for the dedicated work that they are doing.

## What’s the biggest challenge to innovation you face in Oakland?

We are scared to fail.

Our bureaucratic systems have been built to hold government accountable. Everything that we do is held under public scrutiny and our citizens (including myself at times), can be quick to point the finger when mistakes are made. So we don’t experiment. We build technology behind closed doors until we feel that everything is perfect. But, by the time we launch the new technology, it is outdated, and doesn’t reflect the needs of our citizens. So after all of our effort for perfection, we sometimes end up failing anyways.

Our partnership with Code for America has taught us a lot about working with lean processes, delivering the minimum viable product, and taking risks and experimenting before it is too late. It is exciting to incorporate these processes into other work that we are doing. To truly be innovative, we must learn how to fail.

## What&#8217;s your favorite part of your job?

I love a good challenge, and there is no shortage of challenges here. One day I will be working on understanding and communicating crime statistics and the next day I’ll be redesigning a customer service process. It is incredibly exciting to bring new technologies and new ways of thinking into City Hall and to watch the culture of the City transform into a more open, transparent, and collaborative environment.
