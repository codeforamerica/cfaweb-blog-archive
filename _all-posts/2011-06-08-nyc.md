New York City and Code for America are partnering to support teachers with new data tools. Technology has enabled some schools to closely monitor and document student performance, and educators have leveraged that information to make data-driven instructional decisions, which have shown significant gains in student performance. This system, however, requires continual collection and analysis of student achievement. The New York Department of Education’s current student reporting system only collects and displays data on student achievement one or twice a year &#8212; this means New York’s teachers and school leaders have only one or two opportunities a year to assess what works and chart a new course around what doesn’t.

Code for America will develop a reporting system to capture, store, and display valuable achievement data collected at the school level. This will enable teachers to easily input and analyze this data. The tool will give educators and school leaders the opportunity to proactively diagnose student needs and identify effective teaching practices.

### The Challenge

New York is a finalist for the 2012 Code for America Fellowship, and if selected, it’ll be up to a team of CfA Fellows to take on this challenge. In less than a year, they’ll need to work with the city and our local partners to go from concept to delivery &#8212; with everything from research and marketing to development and testing. Up for the challenge? We’re now accepting applications. [](../apply)
