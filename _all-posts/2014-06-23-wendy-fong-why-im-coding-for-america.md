  Working at a community college is a unique job. My students range from new high school graduates to retired older adults. The social, economic, cultural, and political spectrums are as diverse as the city itself. Imagine every passenger on the bus is in your classroom. In that way, I see myself as a bridge between students and their wider career and life goals. I’m teaching, mentoring, collaborating, and designing ways for students to hack their lives. It’s often a challenging job, but the service aspect has kept me inspired and dedicated.

  The tech industry is increasingly changing the fabric of the city. My students are noticeably affected. Higher costs of living, unfair evictions, social injustices, and diminishing opportunities for the working class and families are a reality. I started to ask myself:  how might I best use my skills to make a broader impact beyond the classroom?

  I sought new outlets for community engagement via civic-minded hackathons, pro-bono work with non-profits, and skillshare workshops. While I never considered leaving teaching, the Code For America Fellowship was the perfect opportunity; a natural progression from serving students to serving citizens. As a CFA Fellow, I’ll continue to be a bridge, connecting the dots to more accessible ways to engage and participate in government; taking it back and rewriting the script. In this new role, I’m continuing to teach, mentor, collaborate, design, and serve.

  This is why I’m coding for America.
