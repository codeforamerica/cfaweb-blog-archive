Six months ago, the Fellows came together for its [first hackathon](http://codeforamerica.org/2013/01/31/not-another-hackathon/), and there, we created the initial prototype for [Streetmix](http://streetmix.net/). Since then, we&#8217;ve received so many encouraging responses from users around the world, such as transportation planners in Raleigh, N.C. a community engagement specialist in Vancouver, Canada, and architects and urban designers in Brazil. As a result, we&#8217;ve continued working on Streetmix during [Labs Friday](http://codeforamerica.org/labs/) and in whatever free time we could spare during our Fellowship, and already, Streetmix has helped a small community [protest against widening highways in Sioux Center, Iowa](http://siouxcentercrg.com/), visualized [BRT planning in Albuquerque, N.M.](http://urbanabq.com/2013/06/13/central-avenue-the-necessity-of-a-strong-vision-community-champions-and-street-trees/), shined a spotlight on [bike safety in Seattle](http://www.seattlebikeblog.com/2013/08/05/city-will-study-improvements-to-notorious-section-of-dexter-between-denny-and-mercer/), and engaged the public on [streetscape master planning in Aukland, New Zealand](http://transportblog.co.nz/2013/07/27/ponsonby-rd-masterplan-released/). Someone even [forked and translated Streetmix into Spanish](http://resma.cl/streetmix/)!

Today, we&#8217;d like to announce that Streetmix is now in public beta, with [a new look and new features we&#8217;re all very proud of](http://streetmix.net/help/about-beta). Check it out!
