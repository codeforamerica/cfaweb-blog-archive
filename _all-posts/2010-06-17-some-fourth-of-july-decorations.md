As we approach the Fourth of July, we couldn&#8217;t help but think of some words of inspiration from some of our Gov (1.0) heroes. For centuries, they have helped define the very principles we want our fellows to realize through Gov 2.0: democracy, participation, and patriotism. In that spirit, I gathered together some of our team&#8217;s favorite lines and [published them as posters](http://codeforamerica.org/binary-art) &#8212; modernized a bit &#8212; for our 21st century audience.

  <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/binary-art"><img class="size-full wp-image-421   aligncenter" style="padding-top: 40px; padding-right: 60px; padding-bottom: 30px; padding-left: 60px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 0px; border: 1px solid #cccccc;" title="madison" src="http://codeforamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/madison.jpg" alt="madison" /></a>
</p>

[Check out all eight](http://codeforamerica.org/binary-art), and if you think we&#8217;ve missed one, let us know at [@codeforamerica](http://twitter.com/codeforamerica). **Share**, **print**, and **post** them to spread the word, and help others see how we&#8217;re all &#8212; coders old and new &#8212; speaking the same language.
