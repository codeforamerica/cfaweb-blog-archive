As a testament to the hard work of the city and community, Austin City Council has [approved](http://www.austintexas.gov/news/city-council-adopts-fiscal-year-2012-2013-budget) room in the 2013 budget to form an Innovation Office that will continue to pursue open and new approaches to government.

As Council Member Laura Morrison noted last week, &#8220;We would like to put a stake in the ground&#8230; we are going to fund and move forward [on this].&#8221; ([Watch the video here](http://austintx.swagit.com/play/09102012-503/#7), starting at 22:00.) As CM Morrison notes, it&#8217;s about both the technology and the relationship between internal and external stakeholders that will help make this successful. If the current momentum continues, this shouldn&#8217;t be much of a problem for the city.

Some examples from this year that immediately come to mind include the participation of city employees at our hackathons in [February](http://codeatx.wikispaces.com/) and [last weekend](http://codeacrossaustin.wikispaces.com/), well-received presentations to city and regional departments on agile software development and cloud computing, [AustinGO public updates](http://austintexas.gov/blog/where-were-and-road-ahead-part-3) on continued development of the city&#8217;s web site (built in Drupal), the city&#8217;s attention to [ideas](https://austintexas.granicusideas.com/) generated on [various](https://neighborland.com/questions/atxhackathon) sites, continued attention to populating [the city data portal](http://data.austintexas.gov/), the working group drafting an implementation of the [December 2011 Council resolution](http://www.ci.austin.tx.us/edims/document.cfm?id=161941) for a citywide open government framework, apps [built](http://codeforamerica.org/2012/03/12/getting-started-in-atx/) or [improved](https://twitter.com/i/#!/search/realtime/%23cfaATX?q=%23cfaATX) during our events, and the many conversations we&#8217;ve facilitated between city employees and community stakeholders. More examples can be found in the Code for America Austin [newsletter archives](http://codeforamerica.org/austin).

In short, the strength and engagement of Austin&#8217;s community is matched in few other places, if at all, and the history of engaged [community groups](http://www.facebook.com/events/472010846152363/) working with city government is combining to write the next chapter of Austin&#8217;s open government story.
