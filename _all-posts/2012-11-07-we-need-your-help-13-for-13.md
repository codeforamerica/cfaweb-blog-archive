If you&#8217;re reading this, you&#8217;re part of the CfA family. You&#8217;ve probably attended our events, worked with our fellows, or are hacking for change yourself.

**Now we&#8217;re asking for you to help in one more way.** 

As a non-profit, everything we do is supported by contributions. We&#8217;ve been lucky enough in our first three years to receive generous grants from <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/supporters" target="_blank">foundations and corporate partners</a>. But in order for us to keep growing, we&#8217;re going to need our community of individual supporters to help us as well &#8212; **which is why we&#8217;re holding our first annual campaign to raise grassroots funds to support our work.**

Code for America has grown from the initial idea of a year-long public service fellowship for tech-sector talent (developers, programmers, designers) into a powerful community of tech geeks, enterprising public servants, and startup companies who are redesigning the citizen-government relationship for the 21st century. It&#8217;s a movement to bring nimble, open-source, cloud-based tech into government &#8212; and, even more important, **to re-energize citizens and support governments across the country.**

We’ve shown that our core model works: the cities are using new and creative technologies, the apps our fellows have created are being redeployed, dozens of public datasets have been opened, and citizens everywhere are taking a fresh look at how they can engage in their local government and use technology to improve their communities. We&#8217;ve touched the lives of everyday people, who have used the tools designed by our fellows to give input on urban planning decisions, sign up to dig out fire hydrants in snowstorms, find out when their bus is coming, and prepare for wildfires.

**Most inspiring, though, is the impact on culture.** We&#8217;re helping to facilitate major changes in what people think is possible in local government, and we&#8217;ve activated great public servants at all levels. Our fellows, government partners, and brigade members are changing the perception of government from something that is imposed on us to something that we do together to tackle problems that we all share.

We&#8217;re poised for even more success next year &#8212; and we need your support to do it.  **Our goal is to raise $13,000 in online grassroots contributions to support our 2013 programs &#8212; 13 for &#8217;13.**

Every day you inspire us. Code for America is truly a community effort, a broad movement made up of thousands of people across the country who are rolling up their sleeves and building the kind of government they want to see.

Now we hope that community will come together to show your continued support for our programs. Whether it&#8217;s $25, $50, $100, or whatever you can give &#8211; every dollar counts, and your donation will help make our 2013 work possible.

[Please give online this month at http://codeforamerica.org/donate.](http://www.codeforamerica.org/donate) We&#8217;ll send you a custom CfA 2013 Annual Campaign sticker to show everyone that you&#8217;re behind us!

With your help, we can do it &#8212; $13K for &#8217;13!
