Calling all organizers, government staff, developers, designers, and anyone who wants to fix things that matter! [National Day of Civic Hacking](http://hackforchange.org/) is around the corner which means that it&#8217;s time to [register your event](http://hackforchange.org/).

For the past two years, Code for America has helped plan this inspiring day of action as a member of the organizing team. We&#8217;re thrilled to announce that this year, we&#8217;re getting even more involved by leading the organizing efforts that make [National Day of Civic Hacking 2015](http://www.codeforamerica.org/events/nationalday2015/) run smoothly. SecondMuse has previously held this role and will continue supporting the initiative as a member of the leadership team, along with NASA.

We&#8217;ll be focused on supporting local event organizers to plan and execute events that make their communities stronger. In particular we&#8217;re supporting leaders to:

**Organize Inclusive Events**

We&#8217;ll support event organizers to make it easy for everyone, not just anyone, to participate in their event. To help create safe spaces, each National Day of Civic Hacking 2015 event will be required to publish and socialize a [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/codeforamerica/codeofconduct) for their event.

**Deepen Impact **

We&#8217;re here to help event organizers work on issues that matter by offering a theme for National Day of Civic Hacking: Code for America’s [Principles for 21st Century Government](http://www.codeforamerica.org/governments/principles/). Organize your event around one or more of the Principles.

We challenge hackers to work on projects in Code for America&#8217;s three focus areas: [Health, Safety and Justice, and Economic Development](http://www.codeforamerica.org/our-work/focus-areas/). Federal agencies will offer additional challenges in the areas of Climate, Oceans, and Disaster Relief. While unique in their applications, these challenges and their solutions will support the Principles as well.

**Continue the Work After the Weekend**

Making your community better doesn&#8217;t just happen in one weekend. Join your [local Brigade](http://www.codeforamerica.org/brigade/organize) to work beyond National Day of Civic Hacking.
