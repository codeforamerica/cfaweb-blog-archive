I&#8217;ll be real here. We&#8217;d been teaching governments to design for needs, use plain English, and heed the amazing [Gov.uk Design Principles](https://www.gov.uk/design-principles), but in truth Code for America&#8217;s old site was categorized around insider concepts like our &#8220;Fellowship&#8221;, &#8220;Brigade&#8221;, and &#8220;Peer Network&#8221; &#8212; it wasn&#8217;t intentional &#8212; it was built in 2010 for a budding organization with one focus/program and forced to adapt to a rapidly growing org.

We just weren&#8217;t walking the walk and we were confusing visitors in the process.

Armed with our UX guru Cyd Harrell&#8217;s architecture of participation research and user data from Google Analytics, we began transforming our MVP site to cater to the following audiences:

  * Local Government Employees and Officials;
  * Geeks / Techies / Startups; and
  * Institutional Funders / Donors / Sponsors.

The success of the experience is measured via ongoing analytics monitoring and user surveys. And this is where the ugly tests come in.

**THE UGLY TESTS**

You may not know it, but you’ve been experiencing an optimized website experience for some time now. It&#8217;s true that February 14th marked the date we went from ugly to pretty, but we&#8217;ve secretly been testing our user flow and content on the WordPress site this entire time.

We wanted to make sure our audiences found the content useful before we baked it into a beautiful design. So for example, we’ve been monitoring the Google Analytics conversion goals on the [codeforamerica.org/cities](http://codeforamerica.org/cities/) and [codeforamerica.org/geeks](http://codeforamerica.org/geeks) pages, all the while sending these pages to Brigade captains, public servants, and city officials for additional feedback.

We asked them whether the pages made them feel included, informed about current events, and inspired to contribute to civic tech. This told us if we were accomplishing our design goals of currency, optimism, and openness. From here we looked at whether or not there was an uptick in the number of people “doing” civic tech and tweaked content until we felt satisfied with a page&#8217;s performance.

In the first three months that we launched the Cities page, we quadrupled the number of government employees interested in our programs. We&#8217;ll continue to tweak the Geek and Donor experience over time,  but our overall performance for both is still an improvement from the old site by more than 15 percent.

To me, this process of testing before beautifying has been a crucial one. We’re being true to our values and attempting to use data and people to inform a better user experience. While we recognize that this will be an ongoing process, we also know that our community will continue to help us improve the site over time. Thank you for all the feedback, pull requests, and comments. You’re helping us iterate as an organization and we’re eternally grateful.
