Captricity was a member of the inaugural class of seven <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/blog/2012/10/24/captricity-why-were-coding-for-america/" target="_blank">civic startups</a>. This week, CfA just welcomed its <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/blog/2014/07/10/announcing-the-2014-code-for-america-accelerator-class/" target="_blank">third Accelerator class</a> — we wish them the best of luck. The Accelerator program played a really important role in our development. First, it showed us that tackling the government market is possible, even at the federal level. But more importantly, it helped us see why the work is vital. We are a mission-driven organization, and we were proud adopt as our own CfA’s goals in helping government become more efficient and transparent.

A lot has happened since we went through:

  * We achieved HIPAA and FISMA compliance and helped the FDA digitize mission critical paper forms as part of <a href="https://open.fda.gov/update/openfda-innovative-initiative-opens-door-to-wealth-of-fda-publicly-available-data/" target="_blank">openFDA</a>, their new open data platform for consumer protection.
  * We helped the State of Georgia’s Department of Ethics <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/government/cloud-computing/georgia-solves-campaign-finance-data-challenge-via-ocr/d/d-id/1204471" target="_blank">make good on its open data goal</a> to make financial disclosures and campaign contributions public.
  * And today, we’re excited to announce that we’ve raised $10 million in our Series B investment round, led by Atlas Venture, and partnered with New York Life, the Fortune 100 life insurance company.

This kind of work is why I founded Captricity in 2011 – so many organizations are quietly fighting paper backlogs and struggling to make use of their data. Government programs, hospital front desks and insurance claims processing backrooms are inundated with paper, slowing insight and limiting efficiency, and sometimes denying well-being to people who deserve better health.

For our government, “How do we go paperless?” is the wrong question to ask. Paper is not the problem – getting accurate, timely data is the problem. With institutions that uphold crucial services, like healthcare and insurance, you can’t start over – you have to transform the status quo.

This new funding and partnership mean a whole lot to us, propelling our mission to give organizations of all types access to the data that drives the world forward.
