We have identified several substantial and core problems common in cities across the country and have listed them as example projects below. We are eagerly seeking local government partners willing to take on these challenges as their Code for America Projects. If you believe your city would benefit from one of these projects or something similar, you are encouraged to include these descriptions in your application.

**New Business Gateway
  
** 

> Small businesses are an essential component to healthy and vibrant communities. They employ about half of the US workforce and generate tax revenue for local governments. Starting a small business has many inherent obstacles, and the city shouldn&#8217;t be one of them. Most small business owners typically apply for permits from over 7 departments or agencies, and that&#8217;s before opening their doors to customers. Each of those permits tend to take up to 30 to 60 days for review and processing, which means the business is delayed from opening over one year, just because of paperwork. These delays stifle small business development and inhibit entrepreneurism.
> 
> During these fiscally tough times it is important for cities to support economic development opportunities that promise to further the health of their communities and support the citizens living within them. Code for America believes there is an opportunity to use technology to create efficiencies in the small business permitting processes. The promise of this kind of web application is not only in improving the way government is doing business, but also in helping small businesses work smarter by knowing which permits are required, where their permit applications are in the process, and when they can expect to receive them. Using web 2.0 principles, Code for America and a partnering city can develop a solution that creates efficiency, cost-savings, and transparency, while stimulating the local economy.

**Asset Tracking and Transparency
  
** 

> The complex network of roads, pipes, wires, and tunnels are the backbone of a city, ensuring the functioning of key necessities such as commerce, housing, plumbing and electricity. While citizens don&#8217;t often think about this underlying infrastructure, cities dedicate substantial resources to maintaining these essential networks of assets. For the system to function optimally, each item must be regularly assessed for repair and replacement needs, and since each asset has a unique cost, lifespan, and role, the overall maintenance of the system is both difficult and expensive.
> 
> Code for America sees an opportunity for cities to build (or build upon) asset management programs that are transparent, systematic, and scalable. With more organized and accessible data, the city could better leverage information resources and improve staff&#8217;s ability to find and derive value from the information. By opening up some of that data, the city could help citizens better understand the full cost and need of current and potential service requests. An asset tracking solution built using Web 2.0 principles would help cities work better and better serve their citizens.

**Harnessing the Power of the People
  
** 

> Citizen requests for government services are usually one-time, anonymous communications that include only basic information such as issue type and location. Cities respond on their end through call centers and issue tracking applications, focused on the constituent&#8217;s problem, not the constituent. This model limits the type and quality of interactions that governments can have with citizens and that citizens have with one another.
> 
> Code for America believes that there is a missed opportunity when government focuses on issue tracking and not the larger picture: a collective group of citizens interacting with government for a common purpose. That common purpose is powerful, it caused individuals to take action. Code for America wants to partner with a local government to facilitate collective action and enable a new model where government is not at the center of the interaction; rather it is among the individuals and groups interested in working towards a common solution.
