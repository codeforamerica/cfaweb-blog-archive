Despite graduating college at the top of my class, I struggled to excel during my first years within the software industry without understanding why until recently. I enjoyed my work but never seemed to have the drive of many of my colleagues. I could tell that they were completely in love with technology and relished using it in any way. I, on the other hand, enjoyed using technology but never enough to go the extra mile. Technology was not enough of a motivator to make me a great developer.

But that changed when I first started my job at <a title="Azavea" href="http://azavea.com" target="_blank">Azavea</a>. There, I started building tools that had value beyond the implementing technologies or revenue they generated. These projects had social value. They helped our local governments to work a little better, our environment to be a little greener, and our communities to be a little stronger. My work finally mattered. I realized that I had the creative power to make the world better through my work and, in so doing, unfettered a passion for technology as a means of creation and transformed what had been mere work into a vocation.

Why do I want to participate in Code for America? I have built software that has brought tangible value into the world, and it has given me such an unparalleled sense of satisfaction that I simply must do more. I am captivated by the idea of government as a platform rather than a service provider, and I believe that people will get abundantly more value out of such a model. The chance to work on such an interesting project alongside a team of passionate developers and be mentored by top Gov 2.0 leaders is the opportunity of a lifetime. I would like not only this single opportunity to make an impact on government but the experience, skills, and connections to make it a life-long vocation.
