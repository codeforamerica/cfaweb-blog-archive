excerpt: By the time the Code for America team met with Tommy Jones, the interim CTO for Philadelphia, it was five in the evening, and my mind was spinning. I was struggling to keep everything in my mind all at once. We had met with leaders in the Department of Technology, and in the Mayor’s office, and even with the Mayor himself.

Philadelphia is still Benjamin’s town. Benjamin Franklin’s got a parkway, a bridge, an institute, and a field all with his name on them, which isn’t bad for a guy who left the scene hundreds of years ago.

Besides being a man to name big things after, he was a man of big quotes. Quotes that cut through noise and deliver clarity.

Quotes like: &#8220;A small leak can sink a great ship.&#8221; and &#8220;An investment in knowledge pays the best interest. &#8221;

Words to help orient and center yourself.

A little bit of centering was something sorely needed after our first day. By the time the Code for America team met with Tommy Jones, the interim CTO for Philadelphia, it was five in the evening, and my mind was spinning. I was struggling to keep everything in my mind all at once. We had met with leaders in the Department of Technology, and in the Mayor’s office, and even with the Mayor himself.

We’d been sponging up information all day, and now my brain was leaking in the form of questions. What were we doing tomorrow? How were we going to deal with this, and that, and that other thing? What was the best way to connect citizens and government, and keep them engaged?

Then Jones hit me with a quote:

> &#8220;Everything begins and ends with information.” 

When Tommy Jones says something like that, you listen. He started his career when computer technicians fed giant machines punch cards, and he hasn’t missed a byte since. [Through the years](technicallyphilly.com/2011/01/28/tommy-jones-interim-city-of-philadelphia-cto-top-three-priorities-for-2011) he’s written software, led development teams, and just about anything else under the tech umbrella; most recently he was the Deputy CTO in Washington D.C., where he not only led the redesign of DC.gov but also helped launch the innovative Apps for Democracy contest that produced 47 apps in 30 days.

Memories from the day started falling back in place. It was like he defragged my mind.

[<img src="http://codeforamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/team_w_nutter-300x225.jpg" alt="" title="team_w_nutter" class="size-medium wp-image-3581" />](http://codeforamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/team_w_nutter.jpg) 

I flashed to mid-day, when the fellows were sitting in Mayor Nutter’s conference room. Information, he was saying, is something you want the people to have. Without it there can’t be any real discussion of what to do, and in its absence, government doesn&#8217;t prosper. Whenever a citizen has a difference with government, and government has all the facts, he said, &#8220;Thats an argument we are always going to lose.&#8221;

I thought about our training in San Francisco, at the Code for America Training. [Clay Johnson had told us](http://codeforamerica.org/2011/02/02/clay-johnson-on-our-conspiracy-you-are-the-new-scribes/) we were to be a new kind of scribe, trying to carry the torch in a new direction. We started with information. Here in &#8220;The City of Brotherly Love&#8221; we are collecting information, from the game-changing ideas of Tommy Jones to the crucial insights from the Department of Technology&#8217;s Jeff Friedman. When we leave here we will build a way to share information in a way that helps local leaders solve local problems.

Everything begins and ends with information. Even Ben Franklin could agree to that maxim. After all, the first title on his tombstone here in Philly reads: a printer. And that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re trying to do here in Philadelphia, to get all the information people need to the people who need it. While we aren’t at the solution yet, its useful to have the problem squared in mind.
