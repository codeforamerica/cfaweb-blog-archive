Last month, [Transportation Camp came to San Francisco](http://codeforamerica.org/2011/03/23/discovering-your-inner-transit-geek-at-transportation-camp-west/), and I had the opportunity to present an Ignite talk on a transit-related issue. My family has been either car-lite or car-free for some years now, I thought I&#8217;d share my learnings and experience living in the city. Check out video of the event below.
