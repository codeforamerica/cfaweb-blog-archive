March marks and exciting month for Code for America for two reasons.  First, it marks the return of our 2013 Fellows &#8211; they have just returned to San Francisco from their month-long residency in their respective cities and counties.  Secondly, at the end of the month, our application process for 2014 Fellowship cities/counties will close.  We&#8217;ll know which cities and counties, big and small, all across America are looking to code for America in 2014.

Over the past several months I&#8217;ve had the unique opportunity to speak with change agents in local government about the Code for America Fellowship and the incredible value the program provides their community.  If you&#8217;ve wanted to learn more about the Fellowship, or if your city is considering applying for a slot in the program, you should watch this amazing video. The video highlights some of our former and current partners inside city halls.  While I could talk all day about the amazing work of <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/fellows" target="_blank">our Fellows</a>, I don&#8217;t think anything, or anyone, quite articulates the effect of the fellows and the power of the Fellowship program like those we&#8217;ve worked with, day-in and day-out.

If you&#8217;re like Amanda Deaton, John Tolva, Mayor Joe Reardon, Peter Koht, Karla Henderson, or Allen Square, or any of our dedicated partners in local government &#8212; who deserve a standing ovation of their own &#8212; and you want to impact change in your city or county, watch this video. And, afterwards take a look at the application <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/gov2014" target="_blank">here</a>.
