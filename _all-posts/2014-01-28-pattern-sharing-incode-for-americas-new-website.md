_This guest post was [originally published on Clear/Thinking](http://clearleft.com/thinks/patternsharing/)._

[Mike](http://mike.teczno.com/) has written about [the Code for America alpha website](http://www.codeforamerica.org/2014/01/17/code-for-america-alpha-website/) that we collaborated on:

> We chose to work with ClearLeft because they develop a [pattern portfolio](http://clearleft.com/thinks/onpatternportfolios/) (a pattern/style library) which would allow us to scale our work to our Brigades. This unique approach has aligned perfectly with our work style and decentralized organizational structure.

Thankfully, I think the approach of delivering a pattern portfolio (instead of just pages) isn’t so unique these days. Mind you, it still seems to be more common with in-house teams than agencies. The [Mailchimp pattern library](http://ux.mailchimp.com/patterns) is a classic example.

But agencies like [Paravel](http://paravelinc.com/) are—like Clearleft—delivering systems, not pages. [Dave](http://daverupert.com/) wrote about providing [responsive deliverables](http://daverupert.com/2013/04/responsive-deliverables/):

> Responsive deliverables should look a lot like fully-functioning [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap)-style systems custom tailored for your clients’ needs.

I think that’s a good way of looking at it: a Bootstrap for every project.

[Here’s the front-end style guide for Code for America](http://codeforamerica.clearleft.com/).

Usually these front-end deliverables will be password-protected on the Clearleft extranet for the client’s eyes only, but [Code for America](http://codeforamerica.org/) is all about openness, so they’re more than willing to let us share it with the world. That makes me very happy. I remember [encouraging the people at Starbucks to publish their front-end style guide](http://adactio.com/links/5321/) and [I’ve written about this spirit of sharing before](http://adactio.com/journal/5334/):

> These [style guides and pattern libraries](http://maban.co.uk/66) aren’t being published in an attempt to provide ready-made solutions—every project should have its own distinct pattern library. Instead, these pattern libraries are being published in a spirit of openness and sharing …a way of saying “Hey, this is what worked for us in these particular circumstances.”

If you’re poking around [the Code for America style guide](http://codeforamerica.clearleft.com/), you’ll notice that it borrows some ideas from the [pattern primer](http://adactio.com/journal/5028/) idea I published a while back. But in this iteration, the markup is available via a toggle—a nice variation. There’s also [a patchwork page](http://codeforamerica.clearleft.com/patchwork.php) that provides a nice glance-able uninterrupted view of the same patterns.

Every project is a learning experience and each front-end style guide gives us ideas about how to do the next one better. In fact, [Mark](http://clearleft.com/is/mark-perkins) is busy working on better internal tools for creating these kinds of deliverables—something we’ll definitely be sharing. In the meantime, I’ll be encouraging other clients to be as open as [Code for America](http://codeforamerica.org/) have been in allowing us to share these deliverables.

For more on the usefulness of front-end style guides, be sure to read [Paul’s article on style guides for the web](http://paulrobertlloyd.com/2010/12/styleguides_for_the_web/), [Anna’s classic 24 Ways article](http://24ways.org/2011/front-end-style-guides/), and of course, [Anna’s pocket guide from Five Simple Steps](http://www.fivesimplesteps.com/products/the-pocket-guide-series-collection-4).
