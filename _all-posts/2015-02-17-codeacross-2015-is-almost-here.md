This weekend, February 20-22, thousands of people from around the world will come together for the fourth annual [CodeAcross](http://www.codeforamerica.org/events/codeacross-2015/). Join us!

#### What is CodeAcross?

CodeAcross is a weekend of civic hacking events hosted by nodes of the Code for America network. Inspiring residents everywhere to become actively involved in their community, the theme for CodeAcross 2015 is [Principles for 21st Century Government](http://www.codeforamerica.org/governments/principles/). CodeAcross also coincides with International Open Data Day so many events will have an open data theme.
