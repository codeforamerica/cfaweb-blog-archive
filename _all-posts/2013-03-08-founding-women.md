Today, as many of you know, is International Women&#8217;s Day. Here at Code for America there are many impressive women to behold. And I have the privilege of working with them everyday.

So on this day, I want to take a minute and celebrate these six female founders. These six women are the six female founders here at Code for America. Four are former fellows, one joined the family via the Accelerator, and, of course, there&#8217;s the one women who started it all. Alex, Alicia, Caitria, Jen, Michelle, Serena: Thanks for your passion and your contributions to our community.
