At a few weeks into the development of the Brigade program a status summary becomes useful. Here is what has happened thus far:

  1. We connected with civic hacker communities throughout the country. More cities join weekly. These &#8220;alpha&#8221; cities have agreed to work together to develop the first iteration of the Brigade program.
  2. A <a title="forum home on Google Groups" href="https://groups.google.com/a/codeforamerica.org/group/brigade-dev/topics" target="_blank">forum</a> was established for discussion of program and platform development. Forum membership is moderated, and all discussion is visible to the general public.
  3. We talked to the creators and maintainers of apps that we&#8217;ll adopt and deploy during the alpha program. Apps include <a title="adopt-a-hydrant in the marketplace" href="http://marketplace.civiccommons.org/apps/adopt-hydrant" target="_blank">Adopta</a>, <a title="Public Art Finder on CfA github" href="https://github.com/codeforamerica/public_art_finder" target="_blank">Foo Mapper</a>, <a title="Open Data Catalog on Azavea's github" href="https://github.com/azavea/Open-Data-Catalog" target="_blank">Open Data Catalog</a>, and <a title="PDXAPI on Civic Commons Marketplace" href="http://marketplace.civiccommons.org/apps/pdxapi" target="_blank">PDXAPI</a>. Each of these have demonstrated viability and sustainability for the cities in which they have been used.
  4. CfA staff participated in an inception event facilitated by <a title="Parker's Bio at Pivotal" href="http://pivotallabs.com/users/parker/profile" target="_blank">Parker Thompson</a> of <a title="Pivotal Labs home page" href="http://pivotallabs.com/" target="_blank">Pivotal Labs</a>. The eight hour session generated the <a title="User stories spreadsheet in Google Docs" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AsosB28mzLF6dEVKNHRKUXRhbmlyVEV4THdHN29BN1E" target="_blank">product design</a> for the Brigade&#8217;s web platform.
  5. The [first call among alpha cities](https://groups.google.com/a/codeforamerica.org/group/brigade-dev/browse_thread/thread/cf77d7c98c9edf55 "Google group call info & agenda") was held on Friday, January 20.

On the horizon: Fellows will host events in each of their cities on February 25. We are targeting this date for simultaneous Brigade events. Contact <a title="email Jack Madans" href="mailto:jack@codeforamerica.org" target="_blank">Jack Madans</a> to participate where you live.
