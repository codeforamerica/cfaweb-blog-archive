[<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-14916" title="" src="http://codeforamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/flagonbuilding.jpg" alt="" />](http://codeforamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/flagonbuilding.jpg)Today is the day of the year we have set aside to reflect on and appreciate the value of our country and our government. So let’s do that, let’s really think for a few minutes about the form of government the framers of our country believed in, fought for, and set about building. And let’s think about that in the context of the world we live in today, the ways in which the framers’ intentions are still being realized, and the people who are still helping, to this day, to realize them. I can’t help but give a shout out to two true patriots in our federal government, [Todd Park](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Park) and [Steve Van Roekel](http://www.cio.gov/profile/VanRoekel-Steven.cfm), who are doing such courageous work to make our government work for the people. But while we usually think about Washington on this day, I want to give a big shout out to the most practical, effective, relevant elected leaders in our country today: **our nation’s mayors**.

The founding fathers didn’t care much for cities, and their greatest endorsement of local government was the lack of bureaucracy. Today, you can’t look at the challenges we face as a species living on an overburdened planet and not see the benefits that cities provide, benefits to reducing our ecological footprint, to creating economic benefit, to providing opportunities to women to live as equals to men, to fostering innovation and creativity. And today, while every level of government struggles with bureaucracy that is sometimes necessary and sometimes hindering, cities are the most can-do, practical government entities in our complex system, eschewing ideology for service and talk for action.

There is a groundswell of support and admiration for our nation’s mayors these days, one to which I’m proud to add Code for America’s voice. [Benjamin Barber](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Barber) recently came to San Francisco’s [Long Now lecture series](http://fora.tv/2012/06/05/Benjamin_Barber_If_Mayors_Ruled_the_World) to talk about his forthcoming book <span style="text-decoration: underline;">If Mayors Ruled the World</span>. There was so much wisdom and smart thinking in his talk, of which I’ll share this bit (as reported by our host Stewart Brand):

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <em>[Cities] collect garbage and collect art rather than collecting votes or collecting allies. They put up buildings and run buses rather than putting up flags and running political parties. They secure the flow of water rather than the flow of arms. They foster education and culture in place of national defense and patriotism. They promote collaboration, not exceptionalism.</em>
</p>

Mayor Mike Bloomberg gets a lot of (deserved) attention for his achievements in making New York work better. Barber called him out for his willingness to act on issues like obesity and safety where the federal government has not acted, and for his tapping other cities as sources of learning.  Again borrowing from Brand’s report of Barber’s talk:

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <em>After 9/11, New York’s police chief sent his best people to Homeland Security to learn about dealing with terrorism threats. After 18 months they reported, “We’re learning nothing in Washington.” They were sent then to twelve other cities&#8212;Singapore, Hong Kong, Paris, Frankfurt, Rio&#8212;and built their own highly effective intelligence network city to city, not through Washington or Interpol.</em>
</p>

Networks of cities that succeed where national governments don&#8217;t?  Sounds like we might want to be celebrating Interdependence Day today, honoring the innovation and interdependence of our cities.

[<img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-14905" title="NYC311" src="http://codeforamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/NYC3111-150x150.jpg" alt="" />](http://codeforamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/NYC3111.jpeg)

I have my own experience of the effect of Bloomberg and his team on New York City. I moved to New York in 1978 at age eight, and, after a somewhat rocky adjustment to city life, I soon loved it and all it had to offer. My family is still there, so I visit often, often enough to know that if were raising my daughter there today (instead of in Oakland, Calif., where I now live), she would know a city in which the subways show up on time and don&#8217;t smell too bad. A city in which the parks are well maintained. A city that uses data to make smart decisions about the allocation of resources. A city that helps its citizens navigate difficult legal and administrative chores. [My mother](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/17/fashion/the-midwife-becomes-a-status-symbol-for-the-hip.html) owns a brick row house in Inwood, in upper Manhattan, and rents out the downstairs unit. One year, early in Bloomberg’s administration, she had tenants who had stopped paying their rent. On a nurse-midwife’s income, this was financially devastating to her. I remember her calling me in delight and relief to tell me she’d called the city’s new 311 line to ask for advice, and had promptly been given a time to meet with a pro-bono lawyer through one of the city&#8217;s service agencies, who walked her clearly through her options. As I said in my TEDxPhilly talk last year, I love New York, but I love the New York of this decade better than the one I grew up in.

Mayor Bloomberg does get a lot of attention, but he’s not alone in his leadership, and in fact, each of our nation’s innovative, service-oriented mayors has his or her own particular personality and view on making cities great. I can’t help think about the disarming, committed [Mayor Thomas Menino](http://www.cityofboston.gov/mayor/), Boston’s “urban mechanic.” He’s called that because he fixes what’s broken, and he’s earned the title. We were proud in 2011 to be part of his fix of the public school selection process, when the Boston fellows built [DiscoverBPS](http://discoverbps.org/) in a matter of 2 ½ months, to help parents find the right schools for their kids and showcase some of the true gems in the Boston Public Schools. If a sign of a great leader is the team he puts together and the way he supports them, then the [Mayor&#8217;s Office of New Urban Mechanics](http://www.newurbanmechanics.org/) in Boston, led by [Nigel Jacob and Chris Osgood](http://www.governing.com/poy/nigel-jacob-chris-osgood.html), is a testament to Mayor Menino’s leadership.

[<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-14903" title="Mayor Nutter at a CfA Hackaton in Philadelphia" src="http://codeforamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Screen-Shot-2012-07-04-at-12.30.35-AM-300x195.png" alt="" />](http://codeforamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Screen-Shot-2012-07-04-at-12.30.35-AM.png)For charisma and vision, you can’t beat [Philadelphia’s Mayor Michael Nutter](http://www.phila.gov/mayor/). He understands that the city is a collection of neighborhoods, each with its own individual character, that together make a city with a strong sense of place. He is committed to practical government and to open government, and in April signed [an executive order establishing an Open Data policy](http://cityofphiladelphia.wordpress.com/2012/04/27/mayor-nutter-signs-open-data-executive-order-3/) and backing that up with the creation of a Chief Data Officer position. But he doesn’t stop at signing a document. Mayor Nutter walks the talk when he shows up at hackathons and encourages the community to create real value for citizens with the data. He shows by example how important it is that the city staff understand technology in order to use it to govern better, and supports his internal innovators like the amazing [Jeff Friedman](http://twitter.com/#!/phillyphriedman). I think of Mayor Nutter when I read this line from [Tom Steinberg](http://www.mysociety.org/): “what good governance and good society look like are now inextricably linked to the digital.”

I have had the pleasure of meeting a number of mayors recently, with whom we haven’t yet worked, but who clearly demonstrate these traits I want to celebrate today. [Mayor Ed Lee](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Lee_(politician)) in San Francisco, with his long history of serving the city in many roles, including Director of Public Works and City Administrator, is one of those elected officials who has a clear priority: make the city work well for its citizens. San Francisco is a truly great city with a few drawbacks, including weaknesses in its taxi and public transit systems, and Mayor Lee, like Mayor Menino, is on a mission to fix them. I’m equally inspired by the mayor of a smaller city, [Mayor Greg Fischer](http://www.louisvilleky.gov/Mayor/) of Louisville, Ken., whose clear articulation of [concrete innovation plans](http://www.louisvilleky.gov/Mayor/News/2012/5-30-12+bloomberg+projects+rolled+out.htm) (many funded through [Bloomberg Philanthropies](http://bloomberg.org/)) serve as a model for agenda setting and execution for all levels of government.

We talk at Code for America a lot about seeing government through the eyes of its users, and how things like levels of government and competing jurisdictions contribute to a frustrating experience for a citizen just trying to get something done. So often, when we reach out to government about a problem, we hear “that’s not my problem” a half dozen times from a half dozen departments or agencies before we can even begin to find the solution. Of all the mayors I’ve met recently, none have impressed me with their vision that distinct government entities can act as one, to the benefit of everyday citizens, more than the incredibly charming pair of Mayor [Sly James](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sly_James) and Mayor [Joe Reardon](http://www.wycokck.org/dept.aspx?id=1198&menu_id=1094), of Kansas City, Mo. and Kansas City, Kan. respectively. Sitting between the two of them in Orlando last month at the US Conference of Mayors, I felt like I was in rehearsals for a new comedy show starring these obviously simpatico leaders. But it was more than warm and funny. Hearing about how they wanted to make government work for residents of their metro area, no matter which side of the state line they happened to be on, was inspiring. This is the kind of thinking that makes our country better, and it’s part of why I think mayors deserve our appreciation this Fourth of July.

It’s sad that Congress has allowed partisanship to result in gridlock and inaction. But thankfully, mayors around the country haven’t let that stop them from the work they know they must do. I recommend Lizette Alvarez’s [New York Times coverage of the US Conference of Mayors](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/16/us/politics/mayors-see-slight-gains-no-thanks-to-congress.html?_r=2&nl=todaysheadlines&emc=tha23_20120616) as a source for some frank and fiery words from many mayors about the situations they face and the lack of support from Washington. Alvarez quotes Antonio R. Villaraigosa as saying “The word frustrated is too mild; it’s more like disgusted.” She continues:

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <em>Scott Smith, a Republican who is mayor of Mesa, Ariz., which was hit hard by the recession, said the frustration over Washington cuts across party lines. Mayors take pride in their can-do approach to problems, which is not an attribute shared by Washington, he said. “We see first hand how this hurts our citizens,” Mr. Smith said. “That’s how you get close to anger. Their indecision and inability to get things done impacts the community.”</em>
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <em>“Mayors have realized we can’t wait for Congress,” said Jim Brainard, a Republican and the mayor of Carmel, Ind., who along with tackling brass tacks economic issues has focused on quality-of-life concerns in his small city outside of Indianapolis, including the arts, bike trails and roundabouts as a lure to residents. “There are things that need to be done, and can be done now.”</em>
</p>

_**There are things that need to be done, and can be done now.**_ This could be Code for America’s motto. Mayors around the country are doing what needs to be done, so this Fourth of July, let’s do two things. First, let’s give them a big shout out for their service and leadership. If you appreciate your mayor, send a note letting him or her know, post something to Twitter or Facebook and include the #CelebrateMayors hashtag, or find another way to express your gratitude. And second, <a href="http://brigade.codeforamerica.org" target="_blank">let’s vow to help them</a>. Because we know they can’t do it alone, and we know that our founding mothers and fathers didn’t risk their lives to build a new nation so that we could decide 236 years later that governing it was someone else’s problem.
