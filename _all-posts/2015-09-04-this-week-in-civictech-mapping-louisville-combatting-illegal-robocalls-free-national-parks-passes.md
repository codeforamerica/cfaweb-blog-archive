More than [29,000](http://code-for-america-brigade.meetup.com/) people around the globe help make their communities and governments work better through the [Code for America network](http://www.codeforamerica.org/brigade/). Here&#8217;s a brief snapshot of what happened across the network this week:

### Civic Data Alliance Maps Louisville

[Civic Data Alliance](http://www.civicdataalliance.org/) in Louisville, KY developed several interactive maps of the city. The attractive design of the [Tree Canopy Map](https://codeforamerica.cartodb.com/u/civicdataalliance/viz/29995f3a-1b6a-11e5-913e-0e4fddd5de28/public_map) shown below earned a feature in [CartoDB’s gallery](https://twitter.com/CivicDataAlly/status/636224469586067456). Other maps were designed to [improve pedestrian safety](https://codeforamerica.cartodb.com/u/civicdataalliance/viz/0a49e3f4-4aa2-11e5-b148-0e0c41326911/public_map) and address other [important city issues](https://codeforamerica.cartodb.com/u/civicdataalliance).

### Federal Trade Commission Awards $25k to App that Blocks Robocalls

The Federal Trade Commission announced the [winners](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2015/08/ftc-awards-25000-top-cash-prize-contest-winning-mobile-app-blocks) of their National Day of Civic Hacking challenge. The first place prize went to the creators of [Robokiller](http://www.robokiller.com/), an app that blocks and forwards robocalls to a crowd-sourced honeypot. The [Code for Atlanta](http://www.codeforatlanta.org/) group won a runner-up prize in the FTC&#8217;s [DetectaRobo](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/contests/detectarobo) analytic challenge.

### 18F Helps Fourth Graders Get Free Entrance to National Parks

[18F](https://18f.gsa.gov/) just launched [everykidinapark.gov](https://everykidinapark.gov/), a site that guides fourth graders through the process of obtaining a free national park pass for one year. What&#8217;s it like to build a website for kids? 18F [wrote about the experience](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/09/03/every-kid-in-a-park/).

### Hampton Roads Transit App Doubles Users

[Code for Hampton Roads](http://code4hr.org/) developed an app that provides real-time schedule and route data for local buses. Their app makes [catching the bus](http://hrtb.us/) easier than ever, and users have doubled over the past year. About 300 people now use the app daily.
