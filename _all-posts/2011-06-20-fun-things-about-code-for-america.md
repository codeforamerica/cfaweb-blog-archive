A few weeks ago, we [welcomed our summer interns](http://codeforamerica.org/2011/06/15/meet-the-2011-cfa-interns/) to Code for America. During that time each of the Fellows was asked to name one fun thing about working at Code for America, so now we have a list &#8220;fun&#8221; things &#8212; however biased &#8212; about working for Code for America, which I thought we&#8217;d share.

  * [Aaron](http://codeforamerica.org/author/aaron/) &#8211; [Matt Lewis](http://codeforamerica.org/author/matt/)
  * [Alan](http://codeforamerica.org/author/alan/) &#8211; Badgers eat cobras
