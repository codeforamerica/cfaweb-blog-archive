Much has been said about one of last year&#8217;s application, [Adopt-a-Hydrant](http://adoptahydrant.com), a web app designed by 2011 fellows, Erik Michaels-Ober, enabling citizens to claim responsibility for civic infrastructure. Now generally referred to as, &#8220;Adopta,&#8221; the tool has been repurposed to apply to city property ranging from storm sirens to sidewalks.

We&#8217;ve selected Adopta as featured application in our [Brigade campaign, Race for Reuse](http://brigade.codeforamerica.org/pages/race-for-reuse), because as the number of deployments grows, so to does the opportunity for both civic engagement and the sharing of best practices.

What would you &#8220;adopt&#8221; in your city: hydrants, sirens, or something else &#8212; maybe storm drains, intersections, or something else? And just as importantly, how would you promote it? We&#8217;ve seen posters work for Textizen, and events work for Honolulu Answers. What else is there, and what is working.
