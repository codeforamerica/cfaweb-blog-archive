Seattle already has [a lot of media](http://seattlewiki.net/Media) organizations, numerous blogs, and even an existing wiki-building community. So why do we need SeattleWiki.net?

A local wiki that is personal and community-authored can provide needed depth and context to a city&#8217;s media landscape. A local wiki can serve as glue between disparate sources of information and help build a community of citizen journalists through meetups and other events. A local wiki is a personal, inside look at a city. Which means we want to include things like personal experiences and information gathered first-hand.

We might be able to find this information by searching around on Google, or asking friends on Facebook or Twitter. But sometimes that just doesn’t work. And that blog you went to yesterday that had a great post about the history of a building you like down the street? It may disappear someday. There’s no guarantee that blog will always be around.

In the ever-changing and unpredictable environment of the internet, a local wiki is a commitment to telling the story of a city, to documenting the history of a place, and its residents as it happens. A local wiki is a group of neighbors dedicated to sharing with each other the information they need to know to make decisions in their daily lives, whether those decisions involve voting in elections, listening to local bands, or figuring out where the best place to park a car is in any given neighborhood.

So when I browse through sites like DavisWiki, TriangleWiki, or ArborWiki, I know where I to go eat, what groups I want to be involved in, what neighborhoods I&#8217;d want to live in. I read through the pages of DavisWiki like I’m discovering the solved mysteries of another civilization that otherwise I never could have understood.

I feel like I can get to know these cities through their wikis.

I get a sense of the amazing depth and breadth of knowledge people have about the place they live.

I want to know my city – Seattle – the same way. So I’m making [a wiki](http://seattlewiki.net/).
