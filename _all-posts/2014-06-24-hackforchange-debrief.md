The weekend of May 31 to June 1, 2014, over 10,000 people in 123 cities around the world came out to #hackforchange for [National Day of Civic Hacking](http://hackforchange.org/). We&#8217;re excited that Code for America Brigades organized 47 of these events.

Collectively, the National Day of Civic Hacking network accomplished so much in just 72 hours, which you can read about in this [super slick report](http://hackforchange.org/report/) from the #hackforchange team.

We wanted to share some of the amazing #hackforchange accomplishments from the Code for America network.

**Network Highlights**

  * Nearly 2,500 people came out to 47 Brigade events across the country.
  * Redeployment-focused events were trendy this year. Code for <a title="San Francisco" href="http://hackforchange.org/events/san-francisco-day-of-civic-hacking/" target="_blank">San Francisco</a> and Code for <a title="San Jose" href="http://www.eventbrite.com/e/national-day-of-civic-hacking-in-san-jose-tickets-11521381763" target="_blank">San Jose</a> both held redeploy-a-thons. San Juan&#8217;s <a title="Code for Puerto Rico" href="http://code4puertorico.org/" target="_blank">Code for Puerto Rico</a> team asked citizens to create the content for the local wiki of Caguas and Puerto Rico Answers, a re-deployment of <a title="Honolulu Answers" href="http://answers.honolulu.gov/" target="_blank">Honolulu Answers</a>, which was also re-deployed in <a title="Oakland, CA" href="http://openoakland.org/" target="_blank">Oakland, CA</a> for National Day in 2013 and 2014.
  * In addition to the amazing community organizing work accomplished over the weekend, the Brigade network collectively worked on over 150 apps!

**Five Apps You Should Know About out of National Day of Civic Hacking **

  * <a title="Food Rescue Vermont" href="http://food-rescue.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">Food Rescue Vermont</a>: In Burlington, VT a Brigade built an app to assist people interested in donating food. This resource allows citizens to find the best way of composting or sharing their goods with their community members.
  * [Unlock Philly](http://codeforphilly.org/projects/Unlock_Philadelphia):  Using open data and crowd sourcing, Unlock Philly is an app that helps people access Philadelphia who have previously found it a difficult place to get around: persons with disabilities, elderly people, parents with strollers.
  * San Francisco Housing Policy Brief: In San Francisco, Chief Data Officer Joy Bonaguro led this project which presents key data and an overview of current policies to inform the discussion about housing availability in San Francisco.
  * [TrailEditor](http://traileditor.org/): In Portland, OR, the Brigade built apps on top of the [OpenTrails](http://www.codeforamerica.org/blog/2014/06/10/opentrails-season-begins/) standard. TrailEditor allows visitors to simply take a photo of a trailhead, and e-mail it to the agency. The app deciphers the location of the photo, and creates OpenTrails data for the agencies to download.
  * <a title="Harmful Algal Bloom" href="http://developer.epa.gov/hab-challenge/" target="_blank">Harmful Algal Bloom</a>: Civic Hackers in Birmingham, AL worked with the Environmental Protection Agency to create a new tool for reporting Harmful Algal Bloom, which has a severe impact on human health, aquatic ecosystems, and the economy.
