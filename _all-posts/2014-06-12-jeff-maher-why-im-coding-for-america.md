  Dorky glasses, plump, and a little too into video games. I was a walking stereotype of male teenage geekdom in the late ‘90s / early ‘00s. It should come as no surprise that the following things happened:
</p>

  1. <p dir="ltr">
      Girls stayed away from me <img src="https://www.codeforamerica.org/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":-(" class="wp-smiley" />
    </p>

  2. <p dir="ltr">
      I spent the time I could have been dating learning to code
    </p>

  3. <p dir="ltr">
      My programming skills helped contribute to the wealth of sci-fi and game sites on the “interweb”
    </p>

<p dir="ltr">
  Seemed like a good use of time and talents, or so I thought.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  My high school had mandatory community service and when I went looking for a place where I could fulfill that requirement, I saw that the local chapter of <a href="http://www.thearc.org/">The Arc</a> had a posting for someone with “computer skills.” When I arrived, they explained that they had a sizeable library of books to help people learn about intellectual and physical disabilities. Yet, this library was underutilized because no one knew what was in it (or that it even existed). They asked, “could technology be used to help?” Working together, we created a searchable web site where people could see what was in the collection. It was a simple and quick technology solution that helped greatly with an everyday problem: sharing information.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  That was the first epiphany: it was fun to lend my skills to a good cause. The other two came years later.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  The next one occurred while learning about Mahatma Gandhi. His famous quote, “You must be the change you wish to see in the world,” had a profound impact on me. He was a man who saw many [big] problems throughout his life. Rather than simply complaining about them, he became involved in fixing them. This philosophy became core to me, especially when it came to technology.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  The third one came when I had started a new job, in a new town, with new health insurance. Before I had found a primary care physician, I got bitten by a tick and needed to get medicine to prevent Lyme Disease. It sounded easy:  find a doctor accepting new patients on my insurer’s website&#8211;they even had a search filter for exactly that criteria. After 30+ phone calls, it was clear that no doctor in the search results was actually accepting new patients. This database was clearly not connected to anything useful or up-to-date.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  A few years later, <a href="http://www.zocdoc.com/">ZocDoc</a> came onto the scene linking doctors’ scheduling systems directly to a website where people could make appointments online. When I started another new job, I was able to find a doctor that took my insurance and had patient reviews in under 15 minutes. The intersection of patient reviews, insurance filtering, and scheduling systems creates not only a convenient experience for patients and doctors’ offices, but something that plays a part in helping to keep people healthier. I thought, “why can’t more things work like this?”
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  That brings us to my three epiphanies:
</p>

  * <p dir="ltr">
      Using your tech talents to help is enjoyable and fulfilling
    </p>

  * <p dir="ltr">
      Be part of the solution
    </p>

  * <p dir="ltr">
      Connecting people through technology can improve quality of life
    </p>

<p dir="ltr">
  When I learned about Code for America, it was clear that this organization embodies exactly these things &#8212; with a government slant. I knew I had to be a part of it.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  Lots of people forget that we are the government. In other words, it’s an extension of our beliefs and actions. If we choose not to participate in it, it will never get better. My form of participation comes in the way of lending my tech know-how. The web, databases, and computers can’t solve every societal problem, but I’m betting they can be a piece of the solution.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  That’s why I’m here: coding for America. Coding for us.
