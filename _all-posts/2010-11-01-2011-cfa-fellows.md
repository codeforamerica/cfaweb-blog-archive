Today we&#8217;re thrilled to introduce you to our inaugural class of Fellows.

Out of a pool of over 360 amazing applicants, these 20 stood out for their talent, experience, and passion.* They will be the first participants in our experiment to help city governments better leverage the power of the web. Starting in January, it will be their challenge to not only build innovative apps for each of our cities, but also become the leaders of the ongoing movement to make government more open and efficient. Having gotten to know each of them over the past few months, I can assure you that they can and they will.

I hope you&#8217;re as excited as we are to see what together they can accomplish.
