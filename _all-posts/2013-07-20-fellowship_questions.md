Considering applying for the Code for America [fellowship](http://codeforamerica.org/fellows), but have some questions you’d like answered? Lingering doubts? Things you’d like clarified? Fret no more: the fellows are here to help!

We’ll be holding a live Google Hangout with current CfA fellows on Tuesday, July 23 at 6:00 p.m. Pacific. Fellows will be be available to speak about our experiences, and answer any questions you have about the program and application process.

**Update:**
