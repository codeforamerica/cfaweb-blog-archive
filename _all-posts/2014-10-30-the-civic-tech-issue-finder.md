People regularly ask us at Code for America if there is anything they can do to help. We&#8217;ve had to say no far too often. If they don&#8217;t live near a volunteer [Brigade](http://codeforamerica/brigade) or can&#8217;t take a year off to be a [Fellow](http://codeforamerica.org/about/fellowship), we&#8217;ve had to say no.

We can finally say yes. Introducing the [Civic Tech Issue Finder](http://www.codeforamerica.org/geeks/civicissues).

Civic technology groups from all over want help with their work, like this example from the [Ohana project](http://www.smc-connect.org/) that helps find <span style="color: #000000;">community services</span>. This civic tech issue is a discrete opportunity for you to get involved. A tangible way you can flex your skills to fix or improve a real civic technology project. It&#8217;s a cry for help from a civic hacker in the wild. Will you answer?

### The Civic Tech Issue Finder

We&#8217;ve collected thousands of opportunities for anyone to get involved, and the list keeps growing. Any time that a Brigade or Code for All group creates a GitHub Issue with the label &#8220;help wanted,&#8221; we show it off on the [Civic Tech Issue Finder](http://codeforamerica.org/geeks/civicissues). Not just on our site though, we&#8217;ve made this tool [embeddable](http://codeforamerica.org/geeks/civicissues/embed) on any site. See what thats looks like over at [Code for San Francisco](http://codeforsanfrancisco.org).

### How It Works

We keep a list of all the civic hacker groups volunteering their time. We check that list once an hour to see what they are working on. We gather all the activity from their blogs, their Meetup events, and their GitHub projects. Then we expose all of that wonderful activity through the [CfAPI](http://github.com/codeforamerica/cfapi). This API helps us know what&#8217;s happening across the civic technology movement. It lets us make websites like the one for the [Brigade](http://codeforamerica/brigade)  and for [Code for All](http://codeforall.org) that are always current. With some [clever engineering](https://github.com/codeforamerica/civic-issue-finder) from [Christian Rodriguez](http://twitter.com/chrisrodz35), a Summer [Code 2040 Fellow](http://code2040.org), the CfAPI also now powers the Civic Tech Issue Finder.

### You Can Help

> <span style="color: #222222;">I was referred to Code For America from a colleague after expressing </span><span style="color: #222222;">interest in continuing to develop my coding skills. Found the &#8220;Help Wanted&#8221; </span><span style="color: #222222;">area as part of the Civic Tech Issue Finder and thought I could lend a hand. </span> &#8211; [@nickjellings](https://twitter.com/nickjellings)

> I was just looking at the Code for America site and that issue happened to pop up as needing help so I jumped on it. After taking over as ED of the jQuery Foundation I don&#8217;t get to write code much anymore so I&#8217;ve been looking for little places here and there to throw my JS skills at projects that need help. &#8211; [@kborchers](https://twitter.com/kborchers)

### Not Just Coding

It&#8217;s not just coding though. Many of these requests for help don&#8217;t require any technical skills. Civic hacking often needs more than writing javascript. The open civic issues reflect that.
