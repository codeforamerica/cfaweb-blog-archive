More than [29,000](http://code-for-america-brigade.meetup.com/) people around the globe help make their communities and governments work better through the [Code for America network](http://www.codeforamerica.org/brigade/). Here&#8217;s a brief snapshot of what happened across the network this week:

### Beta.nyc Redesigns New Online City Record

For the first time the official news record of New York City is [online and searchable](http://www.nyc.gov/cityrecord).

Watch the television announcement [here](http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2015/08/10/mayor-announces-new-tool-to-search-city-s-public-records.html).
