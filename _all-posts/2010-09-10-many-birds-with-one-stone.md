My new role as City Program Director has taken me to numerous cities to talk with local government staff about the problems they face and the ways technology can help solve them. What I&#8217;m finding is that most cities face very similar problems and constraints.I&#8217;d like to share with you some of the recurring problems I hear about so that together we can support our governments in addressing them.<!--more-->

A systemic problem that I&#8217;ve been hearing about, and experienced first hand in my previous work in local government, is the **applications and back-end database silos** that make multi-agency collaboration extremely difficult. These silos mean that data cannot easily be transferred between the systems (think between &#8220;departments&#8221;) and often the data isn&#8217;t standard, making data analysis either impossible or extremely time consuming. For example, a property owner receives tax bills from the Tax Collector&#8217;s Office where property information is stored and used to determine property values and assessments. The property information maintained in the Tax Collector&#8217;s system is not the same property information used by the Utility Department for utility usage bills, and so the city can&#8217;t easily coordinate tax incentives based on reduced utility usage or conservation, or generate trend data on historical utility usage. The City IT staff see this problem as costly to remedy, though an an open source middleware product might be a good solution.

Another area for improvement is to create an accurate and consolidated staff directory for city employees. I was troubled to find that many cities either **don&#8217;t have a staff directory or have an inaccurate one**. It is easy to understand why collaboration doesn&#8217;t occur if staff doesn&#8217;t know who everyone is, how to contact them, and what others are working on.

I was a personal victim of the inefficiency and inaccuracies of paper-based systems when I worked for two different city governments, and we have heard very similar stories from other city workers. Timekeeping is still done either in paper format or via excel spreadsheets that are completed and printed out, then handed to managers, who approve with a signature, and then forward through internal mail or fax to the Human Resources department. I am not kidding! Let&#8217;s get a plan together to stop this paper pushing in our cities.

These common inefficiencies in government are one of the primary reasons Code for America was founded. We recognize that cities are facing similar problems. We want to create an organization that solves the problem once; with a design that can easily be re-used to benefit any municipality that is facing a similar need. This list of common local challenges will grow, and I will continue to blog about them, not to expose the governments, rather to get our readers excited about the work ahead and illustrate the impact we can make when we solve simple problems like online directories.
