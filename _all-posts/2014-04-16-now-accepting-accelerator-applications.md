Starting now. We&#8217;re accepting applications for our 2014 <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/geeks/accelerator-apply/" target="_blank">Civic Startup Accelerator</a>. This is the third class of civic minded startups and entrepreneurs we&#8217;re looking to help launch to the next level. Over that past two years, we&#8217;ve seen a lot of growth in the civic technology space — it&#8217;s an exciting time to bee in civic tech. In fact, the Knight Foundation <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/knightfoundation/knight-civictech" target="_blank">estimates</a> that $431 million has been invested in civic technologies, and the industry has been growing at 23 percent annually since 2008.

We&#8217;ve seen this trend first-hand, when class of 2012 company MindMixer raised a $4 million Series B last year. And when class 2013 company SmartProcure announced a partnership with City of New York: “If better procurement data reduces the City’s $11 billion contracts budget by just 1 percent, we will realize savings of more than $100 million a year,” said Ari Hoffnung, New York City Deputy Comptroller of Budget and Public Affairs.

Think about joining us as we work to catalyze the civic technology ecosystem &#8212; and to create a government by the people, for the people that works in the 21st century.

We&#8217;ll be accepting applications through May 15, 2014. Take a look at our our <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/geeks/accelerator-faq/" target="_blank">FAQ</a>  to find out more about the Accelerator and the sort of civic startups we&#8217;re looking for.
