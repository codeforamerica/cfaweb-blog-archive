This week, the Boston team had the opportunity to participate in the Ignite Boston to talk about our work with CfA and how we&#8217;re hoping to use technology to improve education. We tried to give a sense of what we&#8217;re doing but also stick to the Ignite motto: &#8220;Enlighten us, but make it quick.&#8221; Video from the talk is below.
