> This is a guest post from Accela, a sponsor of our Brigade and Peer Network, about their [Accela Civic App Challenge](https://www.hackerleague.org/hackathons/accela-construct-app-challenge-2014). Submissions are due on July 7th.

The idea behind the concept of “government as a platform” was to leverage the skills and expertise of private sector civic hackers to remake the way that citizens interact with their government.

Several years on from the time that this term was first coined by Tim O’Reilly, the [expanding world of civic startups](http://codeforamerica.org/geeks/accelerator-faq/) shows us the true value of engineering new ways for governments to work with smart, agile technology companies.

These new firms are remaking the way governments do business.

### A simpler pathway to new businesses

People often underestimate the complexity of registering a new business, particularly for small businesses that are just getting off the ground. Often this process can be lengthy, involve many steps with multiple agencies and end up leaving new business owners frustrated and unsatisfied.

Motivated by improving this all too common common experience with government, Joel Mahoney and Peter Koht created [Open Counter](http://opencounter.us/). Open Counter is a new way to register a business that streamlines the process and makes it quick and efficient for small firms to get up and running.

Originally built through a partnership between Code for America and the City of Santa Cruz, CA, Open Counter now has a growing roster of clients that includes cities across the country. By putting a new, more intuitive interface on top of an existing government process, Open Counter creates a simpler pathway for new businesses through the maze of regulatory and permitting rules, and fundamentally changes the interaction between corporate citizens and their government.

### Harnessing the power of community data

Among the most important and sought after types of information from local governments is data on properties &#8211; licenses, code violations, building permits, etc. This data can directly impact the way that citizens perceive their neighborhoods and the quality of life they enjoy in them.

Often, this data is difficult to obtain, complex to combine and nearly impossible for the average citizen to draw useful inferences from. This results in dissatisfaction, distrust of government institutions and more work for public employees that must field questions from the public (and the elected officials that represent them) who just want a clear picture of what is happening in their communities.

This highly important and hugely complex issue is the one being tackled by [Civic Insight](http://civicinsight.com/). Civic Insight layers intuitive visualizations on top of government data, and empowers citizens by enabling them to track exactly what is happening with properties in their neighborhood

This new civic platform grew out of a collaboration between the city of New Orleans and Code for America and is now being used by other cities to give citizens insight into the often complex world of property data.

### Finding the next great civic startup

These are just a couple of examples of the true power of government as a platform &#8211; enabling ways for smart people with new ideas to improve the way that government works. What do they have in common? Accela is working with both of these startups to deploy their apps on our Civic Platform and extend their reach to our government agency customers that leverage the platform daily.

To that end, we want to encourage more civic startups like Open Counter and Civic Insight. At Accela, we’re committed to finding ways to leverage the talents and ideas of civic entrepreneurs to benefit the governments we serve. We believe that fostering the creation of new civic startups has enormous potential to benefit public sector agencies, and we’re committed to find ways to do this.

That’s why we were thrilled several weeks ago to launch the [Accela Civic App Challenge](https://www.hackerleague.org/hackathons/accela-construct-app-challenge-2014).

The Accela App Challenge is a way to help identify the next set of ideas that can turn into tomorrow’s civic startups. We’re excited to reward and showcase the best new ideas for helping governments do their jobs better. There’s [$25,000 and a trip to San Diego](https://www.hackerleague.org/hackathons/accela-construct-app-challenge-2014/wikipages/536bf9ff18973a9444000001) to present in front of hundreds of government officials at stake. Submissions are due by July 7th.

If you have an idea for how to make government work better, the Accela Civic App Challenge is for you. The idea that sparks the next great civic startup could be yours.
