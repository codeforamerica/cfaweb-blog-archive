This week, representatives from dozens of countries came together at the United Nations in New York for the [Open Government Partnership](http://OpenGovPartnership.org) to discuss shared commitments to making government more [transparent](http://civiccommons.org/2011/09/open-data-bringing-down-the-barriers-to-innovation/), efficient, and participatory. The U.S. published their report, with various commitments to open government, which is available here. More details are available on [OpenGovPartnership.org](http://OpenGovPartnership.org), where updates will be available, but for an overview of the partnership and its mission, check out it&#8217;s beautiful launch video below.
