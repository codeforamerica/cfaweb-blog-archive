[<img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-13684" title="socialcontract" src="http://codeforamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/socialcontract-300x200.jpg" alt="" />](http://codeforamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/socialcontract.jpg)I&#8217;ve never been able to fit into a perfect mold as just a &#8220;lawyer&#8221; or an &#8220;engineer.&#8221;  As much as I enjoy expression of useful ideas in software, I also really enjoy exploring and expressing the nuances of the [social contract](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_contract) at work in this country that I love.

In the private sector, technology and open data has been a disruptive force against monopoly for years, affording Americans greater consumer choices from broadband access to the way we buy real estate. And as web technology and user interface/experience science evolves, the choices grow even larger. In my mind though, the real jewel of technology disruption remains with government &#8211; the heart of the social contract &#8211; being &#8220;A Part of It All.&#8221;

As a society, we are still missing something though when professionals (be they lawyers or programmers) assume that the only way to explore the social contract is through their _particular medium of expression_. You can find dozens of law review articles by lawyers on technology&#8217;s place in law and legal systems, but much fewer realizations of these ideas in [GitHub](https://github.com/) repos. All the same, there are quite a few [budding law tech platforms](http://www.docracy.com/) aimed at exploring/disrupting the practice of law, but in these, I don&#8217;t see full integration of all of the contingencies and breadth of circumstances that a thoughtful law review article, or a court opinion covers.

Perhaps it is due to the reward structure in the two distinct law vs tech sectors favoring either difficult-to-understand-by-the-public academic texts or oversimplified software platforms.  I don&#8217;t think understanding the law should be a privilege only for legal academics, nor do I agree with tech platforms promising disruption, but merely rediscovering (through a series of costly errors) the reason why law may be a bit esoteric to begin with.

As a Code for America fellow last year, I was in the unique position to both [code](http://www.snapfresh.org) and [write](http://wiki.civiccommons.org/Legal_and_Procurement_Issues_Guide) about social contract issues. Then, earlier this year thanks to a [2012 fellow](http://codeforamerica.org/author/joe/), I was encouraged to pitch a session topic for the [Innovate/Activate conference](http://www.innovateactivate.org/) and started a project I&#8217;ve called &#8220;[PatentBat](https://github.com/jerseycoder/USPTO3PS).&#8221;

I found at I/A that I wasn&#8217;t alone &#8211; there is a growing number of &#8220;Lawyers who Code&#8221; trying to thoughtfully and ethically integrate the [nuanced knowledge of the law with technology](http://www.lawgives.org/live/). The aim is to leverage tech into the zeal of zealous advocacy, to make it _better_, rather than focusing exclusively on being cheap. After all, can you put a price on the social contract?

This philosophy is what drives civil servants also, as I saw a month ago attending a meeting of my local chapter of the [Code for America Brigade](http://brigade.codeforamerica.org/). Two town officials from bordering cities/counties attended and began a dialogue on collaborating over front end development for Open 311. They realized the [cognitive surplus](http://www.ted.com/talks/clay_shirky_how_cognitive_surplus_will_change_the_world.html) of the Brigade as a way to make the service _better_, not just make it cheaper.

From my experiences at Code for America and after, it seems that government has a place for people expressing _better_, not just cheaper. As a patent examiner with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, I aim to write thoughtful [actions](http://www.uspto.gov/trademarks/process/update/oa.jsp), while acquiring expertise to thoughtfully integrate into tech platforms I work on in my free time like PatentBat. Maybe, in a few years then, I&#8217;ll have a new label: an &#8220;Administrative Law Judge that Codes.&#8221;
