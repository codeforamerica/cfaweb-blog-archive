“[We have created] A republic. A representative democracy. A government dependent upon the people alone. We have lost that republic. And all of us have to act to get it back.” &#8212; Lawrence Lessig

I heard the above quote after somehow <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/lawrence_lessig_we_the_people_and_the_republic_we_must_reclaim" target="_blank">stumbling into a talk</a> regarding the merits of campaign finance reform, given by a professor I would later come to know as Lawrence Lessig. Lessig painted a bleak picture of the problems our government faced&#8211;problems that were subversive in nature, and large in scope. These were problems that were apolitical, and until these problems were addressed, we had no chance of realizing the merits of our founding fathers.

Needless to say, I disagreed. I stamped my foot down, and pulled the wool even tighter over my eyes. 

Back then, I was an idealistic Government major, content to wax poetic about lofty (and wholly impractical) virtues of the intentions of our founding fathers, while reciting the pledge of allegiance louder, and beating my chest harder than anyone else. I was an armchair patriot — someone who thought he was entitled to present an opinion about our country without ever getting down in the trenches with the people that were actually doing the heavy lifting.

To my naive ears, Lessig’s words were just too bleak, and just too hyperbolic. Our Republic was alive and well! People were not rioting in the streets. Setting aside political differences, many people were generally happy with the way things were.

In the ensuing years, I would receive a brutal awakening to the systematic deficiencies that weighed down our Republic. As it turned out, a [good number of Americans are armchair patriots](http://www.people-press.org/2006/10/18/who-votes-who-doesnt-and-why/). We love our nation, and still have that characteristically unwavering belief that it is the greatest country in the world, yet remain willfully or accidentally ignorant of the very real problems that are entrenched in our government.

My experiences in politics, both working as a part of government at the municipal level and lobbying the government at the federal level [left me disillusioned](http://www.cgdev.org/blog/bipartisan-appetite-reform-food-aid-amendment-fails). I had the wool pulled off my eyes and began to see my country for what it was, warts and all. And I was horrified.

I switched my major to Economics, and decided that I wanted nothing more to do with the public sector. If I was going to change the world, I would do it through private sector innovation. I was attracted to the raw efficiency (and if we’re being honest, the cushy offices) of Silicon Valley, and decided that I would start there.

I got exactly what I bargained for. The talent, ingenuity, and speed of the tech industry was shocking, especially for someone coming out the public and social sectors. And yet, I couldn’t help but feel that something was missing from my experience. The job itself felt right, but at the end of the day, the bottom line and the profit & loss dictated decisions.

I was at an impasse. I wanted to be a political change maker, but didn’t want to risk the corrupting influence of working inside government. I was attracted to the speed and luxury of the technology industry in Silicon Valley, but wanted my highest aspiration to be more than advancing the P&L of my company.

Code for America appeared precisely when I was struggling with this dilemma. Initially I was hesitant — ”there is no way an organization like this exists,” I told myself. Yet, when I started here a little over two weeks ago, I was astounded. This organization did not set out to externally “improve” government, but rather work with the government as involved citizens to create processes and tools that would allow government to improve itself.

Do you know how motivating it is to be surrounded by a group of people who are doing the things you’ve dreamt of doing your entire life, on a national level? I feel privileged to have that validation of my life’s purpose at such an early stage in my career.

Code for America, for me, represents more than simply using technology to improve government. It represents that idea that we don’t have to stick to the cookie cutter, and frankly, ineffective ways to “solve” government. It represents the idea that armchair patriots and the people within government can actually work together to create innovative solutions.

It represents the idea of “WE,” as in, we are all in this together and we can change the status quo.  As in, “We the people.”

As I begin my time at Code for America, I’m reminded of a quote Lawrence Lessig cited from Henry David Thoreau, “There are a thousand hacking at the branches of evil to one who is striking at the root.”

So I’m getting up out of my armchair. I’m climbing down into the trenches. And I am joining the geeks in the private sector and the change makers in the public sector to finally strike at that root.
