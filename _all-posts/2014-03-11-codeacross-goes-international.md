  For the first time, CodeAcross went international &mdash; we didn’t just Code Across America, we CodedAcross the World. Passionate citizens joined forces to use their skills for good and tackle their own community&#8217;s problems in 48 different places &mdash; 11 of them international events. They used CodeAcross as a springboard to convene their communities around a common commitment to advancing civic technology and as a platform for future action.

  I couldn’t be more impressed with the results.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  <strong>Here’s a taste of what happened:</strong>
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  Five international <a href="http://brigade.codeforamerica.org/">Brigades</a> launched: Monterrey, Mexico; Taipei, Taiwan; Zagreb, Croatia; Lahore, Pakistan, and cities throughout <a href="http://codefor.de/">Germany</a>.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  Local partners organized CodeAcross events in 10 different countries, spanning Croatia, Taiwan, <a href="http://www.codeforaustralia.org/">Australia</a>, <a href="http://code4japan.org/">Japan</a>, Mexico, Pakistan, <a href="http://epf.org.pl/kodujdlapolski/">Poland</a>, <a href="http://codefor.de/">Germany</a>, <a href="http://www.codeforall.ie/">Ireland</a>, and Brazil.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  That’s eight time zones, 10 different languages, some pre-Carnival spirit, a whole lot of Guinness, dozens of pizzas, and hundreds of community organizers and civic hackers all coming together to further the global civic hacking movement on <a href="http://opendataday.org/">International Open Data Day</a>.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  Everyday citizens volunteered their time all over the world to work with local government partners to try to figure out ways to use technology to make their communities better. They mobilized to improve the garbage pick-up alert system in Japan, opened up budgets in Zagreb, fostered the civic tech eco-system in Australia, mapped street art in Warsaw, advanced data journalism in Taipei, and passed an open data mayoral decree in Porto Alegre, Brazil, among others.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  This is only a small slice of everything our international partners accomplished at CodeAcross among a very long list of feats.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  I can’t wait to see what they’ll do next.
