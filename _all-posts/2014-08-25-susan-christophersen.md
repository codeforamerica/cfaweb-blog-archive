With a background in information technology, the web, and journalism, Susan communicates with both technical and non-technical users to build connections outside of usual silos. Susan has been involved with Code for America in a many capacities. With all that Susan accomplishes, we wanted to learn about the coalitions she builds to achieve so much in Boulder County and nationally.

### What are some key skills you look for when forming a team for a new project?

Whatever the project, I look for — and work to foster — empathy and curiosity. I love being part of a collaborative team that can see the project from multiple points of view, ask questions about why we do things the way we do, and propose new paths to take.

### What effect do you think open data has on internal communications and team building?

We have committees organized around functions such as GIS, web, or communications. Open data brings together a group of data owners who wouldn&#8217;t normally have a need to collaborate and allows them to share the story of the data they produce and use. This mix of folks brings a new energy, and new internal connections that break down information silos. We kicked off our open data initiative internally in late July and as we move forward, I see the potential for a shift in the way data is created, consumed, shared, and perceived.

Open data has had an effect on our collaboration with the city of Boulder.  We are participating along with the city in CfA&#8217;s <a title="OpenTrails" href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/specifications/trails/index.html" target="_blank">OpenTrails</a> workshop. We plan to post the OpenTrails data on <a title="OpenColorado" href="http://opencolorado.org/" target="_blank">OpenColorado</a> and will be working with other local governments in Colorado to do the same. Part of open data success for me is figuring out how we can collaborate more with other local governments to provide standardized data that crosses organizational lines.

### You currently use SharePoint to communicate and build teams internally. What, beyond software, is necessary to sustain the communal spirit? Have you seen other tools that that function similarly?

If I only knew the secret recipe! We have a very collaborative culture and our SharePoint-based intranet is the central place for communication (outside of email). No matter what the tool, people have to figure out what&#8217;s in it for them or it won&#8217;t get used. We have pockets of people who LOVE SharePoint. They have played around with the functionality and figured out how to make it work for them. Once that happens — stay out of their way and let them create! We are moving to SharePoint 2013 and are excited about the new social features and the potential to connect communities of interest (and bust silos) across the organization.

There isn&#8217;t one tool that meets all needs. When I served on the board of the National Association of Web Professionals (NAGW), we used Google Docs along with conference calls to work together. For a bunch of geographically separated and easily distracted web professionals, being able to make the changes in real-time on a platform where everyone could collaborate was essential to getting things done. At our annual conference, we use GroupMe to keep board members and volunteers in the loop in the manner they prefer (SMS or through an app). When there is AV trouble or a question at the registration desk a GroupMe message can be sent to all, someone can take responsibility for resolving it and everyone knows what’s being done — all in a matter of minutes with minimal interruptions to conference sessions.

### Do you ever run into communication roadblocks when working with those who are less tech-savvy?

When it happens, I look for the nugget that people can relate to. For example, when I started at the county 13 years ago, we had a website that looked like 16 completely different websites. I was having difficulty making a case for moving to a common look and feel. As I walked through the office kitchen on the way to the meeting with the mostly non-technical content creators, I noticed a stack of newspapers. I grabbed a section from each paper and continued to the meeting. Before the contentious topic came up I asked, &#8220;who reads the Rocky Mountain News?&#8221; A committee member raised his hand. I handed him the paper and asked if he would read us the weather. He opened the paper — and seeing the Denver Post inside — said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know where it is; this is the Denver Post!&#8221; I explained that this was the experience residents had on our website. I watched as the concept clicked with each person around the table. After that we were able to move on with the redesign.

### What advice do you have for other county and local web?

Reach out to your peers! One of the things I love about working in government is the willingness to share expertise and collaborate across organizations. Local web folks often wear many hats: they are the photographer, videographer, user interface designer, developer, system administrator, database administrator, and social media expert in addition to maintaining the website. It can be difficult to go very deep when you have so many responsibilities, so share what you know and ask others to help fill in what you don&#8217;t. Nagw.org and the NAGW conference are a great place to connect with peers! </plug>
