Campaigns provide us motivation, inspiration, and support for reaching shared objectives and goals. Each of our [Brigade](http://brigade.codeforamerica.org "Brigade home") campaigns is designed to direct energy in support one of our [five activities](http://brigade.codeforamerica.org/pages/activities "Brigade Activities page"). Each of those activities advances [our strategic outcomes](http://brigade.codeforamerica.org/pages/about#goals "About Brigade"). Our summer campaign, [Open Impact](http://openimpact.us "Campaign home"), was about advocating for changes needed to support government on the web. Our current campaign, [Race for Reuse](http://brigade.codeforamerica.org/pages/race-for-reuse "campaign home"), is about engaging citizens and community groups to address civic issues together.

[Race for Reuse](http://brigade.codeforamerica.org/pages/races-for-reuse "campaign home") is important to us because it connects the engagement of civic-minded technologists with engagement in the general population. We asked you to redeploy these four apps because they share characteristics that are important to us. Foremost, all are applications for engagement and each engages in a different way.

[Textizen](http://textizen.org "textizen home") polls the mobile population about matters important locally. [LocalWiki](http://localwiki.org "localwiki home") enlists writers, editors and curators to &#8220;edit their city.&#8221; [Shareabouts](http://shareabouts.org "shareabouts home") invites residents to participate in planning by answering questions for which a key part of the answers is location. [Adopt-a](http://adoptahydrant.org/ "Adopta home") connects traditional, volunteer maintenance activities with an increasingly digital populace.

Join us on the [Race for Reuse](http://brigade.codeforamerica.org/pages/race-for-reuse "campaign home") campaign to promote and celebrate civic app reuse and civic engagement. We asked you to deploy one of these apps by Election Day &#8212; yesterday.  Now, that&#8217;s done, let&#8217;s get people using them.

It&#8217;s time to engage our communities.
