More than [38,000](http://www.codeforamerica.org/brigade/numbers/) people around the globe help make their communities and governments work better through the [Code for America network](http://www.codeforamerica.org/brigade/). Here&#8217;s a brief snapshot of what happened across the network this month:

### Hurricane Patricia Mapping Response

To prepare for the touchdown of Hurricane Patricia in Mexico, [Mapbox](https://mapbox.com) purchased fresh satellite photos and made them available to the [Humanitarian OpenStreetMap volunteer network](https://hotosm.org/). Using [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/), volunteers mapped out thousands of Mexico&#8217;s roads and buildings to help first responders, aid organizations, and the local governments on the ground. Check out [this visualization of their incredible efforts](https://twitter.com/mapbox/status/658815789995266048).

### Philly Sustainability Hackathon
