More than 27,000 people around the globe help make their communities and governments work better through the [Code for America network](http://www.codeforamerica.org/brigade/). Here&#8217;s a brief snapshot of what happened across the network this week:

### Chicago&#8217;s Million Dollar Blocks

[Chicago’s Million Dollar Blocks](http://chicagosmilliondollarblocks.com/) maps public money used to incarcerate residents for drug related offenses by block. It shows that public money is spent overwhelmingly on certain neighborhoods. Using data, design, research and narrative, this civic technology argues that money is being spent ineffectively and proposes many alternatives. Chicago&#8217;s Million Dollar blocks was beautifully built by [DataMade](http://datamade.us/), in partnership with many local nonprofits and universities.

### San Diego&#8217;s Open Data Inventory

[San Diego Open Data Inventory](http://datasd.gitbooks.io/council_report/content/main/inventory_findings.html) was just released by [Maksim Pecherskiy](http://www.sandiego.gov/pad/about/staff/pecherskiy.shtml), San Diego&#8217;s Chief Data Officer and former Code for America Fellow. San Diego Open Data Inventory is built using Gitbook and R in a reproducible way, as best practice for other cities just starting out with their open data programs.

### NYC BigApps 2015 opens for submissions
