Some of your biggest fans don’t send you mail, they deliver it. Some of them keep the subways going to get people to the ballparks, or secure the streets around them, even if it means catching the game only on the radio. And some of them go to work everyday with the sole purpose of keeping our communities safe and strong. They are our public servants, and they deserve our appreciation.

Public Service Recognition Week is May 1-7. Because of your past advocacy work, we at <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/" target="_blank">Code for America</a> are asking you to let the public service men and women in your life know how much you love their work, and **that you are one of their biggest fans.**

Help us in our effort to show the love for public service by recording a simple video with your message of thanks, and send along a link (info@codeforamerica.org)&#8211; and by simple, we mean just a quick YouTube clip of you talking into your webcam, saying “thank you.” We’ll be weaving all of the submissions together into a video to share out May 1 in our effort to encourage all Americans to recognize the great work done by our public servants.

This is part of a joint project by <a href="http://govloop.com/" target="_blank">GovLoop</a>, the largest public sector social network, and <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/" target="_blank">Code for America</a>, a public service/technology fellowship program. Throughout Public Service Recognition week, we will not only be featuring your statements, but also collecting statements online from citizens across the country about why they love their public servants. Your participation will help us grow a national movement to send our public servants the appreciation they deserve.

We hope you can find a few moments to support this important initiative. Please don’t hesitate to contact us with any questions or concerns. We look forward to hearing from you.
