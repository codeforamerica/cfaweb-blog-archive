We&#8217;re pleased to announce our 2011 Code for America Fellowship Finalists. Out of a pool of over 360, these candidates stood out as the most capable, dedicated, and passionate &#8212; which wasn&#8217;t easy to do. We were so impressed by their qualifications that we wanted to show them off :). See for yourself below.

(Note: Some of the applicants preferred not to be listed publicly for various reasons, and we respected their request, so the list below is not a complete list)

Throughout this month, we will be gathering additional information on the Finalists, ranging from LinkedIn profiles to video interviews and case problem responses, and we will use this information to take on the even more challenging task of selecting the fellows. We will be announcing the 2011 Fellows mid-October.<!--more-->

By night, he dons a cape and fights for urban sustainability by hacking away at Walkshed.org, a sophisticated webapp to map walkability. Regardless of costume, Aaron especially enjoys JavaScript development, GIS, and interesting ways of combining the two. Besides being a tech geek, Aaron enjoys running with Back on My Feet, reading a good book, backpacking hither and yon, a great cup of coffee, and the company of dear friends and family.

**Anna Bloom
  
** <img src="https://codeforamerica.wufoo.com/cabinet/w7x3s5/FwuBelqFgeASSQ%3D/annavbloom_headshot.jpg" alt="" hspace="5" width="75px" align="right" />Anna Bloom wants to join Code for America to continue making creative use of technology to empower citizens and keep the public better informed. After graduating from UC Berkeley&#8217;s Graduate School of Journalism in 2010, Anna worked for YouTube to launch an innovative news project documenting the Bay Area with user-generated video. Prior to that, she regularly contributed to The New York Times Bay Area Blog and co-founded a hyper-local news site for Oakland in 2008. Anna&#8217;s career began when she left Chicago for Park City, Utah, to work as an editor for a newspaper to support her skiing habit.

**Aynne Valencia

What was common to both, according to Code for America applicant and GIS professional Brian Denzer, was that government institutions were failing for years, fostering the conditions for historically unprecedented engineering disasters. As an advocate for using crowd-sourced application development using government data to promote more open government and more engaged citizens, Brian hopes to &#8220;catch-up&#8221; democratic institutions to the 21st century, in order to prevent future such disasters. When he isn&#8217;t making maps or advocating for government reform, Brian loves to partake in the irreverence of Mardi Gras parades and (of course) cheering on the world-champion Saints.
