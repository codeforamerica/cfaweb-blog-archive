### Previously&#8230;

See the first two posts in this series:

  1. [A New Approach to Procuring Government Technology in California](http://www.codeforamerica.org/blog/2015/11/30/a-new-approach-to-procuring-government-technology-in-california/)
  2. [Child Welfare Technology in California, Part Two](http://www.codeforamerica.org/blog/2015/12/07/child-welfare-technology-in-california-part-two/)

### The requests for proposal are out!

  * [RFP OSI 31326 &#8211; Child Welfare Services New System API Module](https://www.bidsync.com/bidsync-app-web/vendor/links/BidDetail.xhtml?bidid=1992805&returnPage=searchResults)
  * [RFP OSI 31801 &#8211; Child Welfare Services &#8211; New System Intake Module](https://www.bidsync.com/bidsync-app-web/vendor/links/BidDetail.xhtml?bidid=1992783&returnPage=searchResults)

If you&#8217;ve been following along over the last few weeks, you&#8217;ll know that we&#8217;ve been working with all of these departments and agencies in California:

  * [Health and Human Services Agency](http://www.chhs.ca.gov/Pages/Default.aspx)
  * [Department for Social Services](http://www.cdss.ca.gov/cdssweb/)
  * [Office for Systems Integration](http://www.osi.ca.gov)
  * [Government Operations Agency](http://www.govops.ca.gov)
  * [Department of Technology](http://www.cio.ca.gov)
  * [Department of General Services](http://www.dgs.ca.gov/dgs/Home.aspx)

to move from a traditional government technology procurement. Traditional government technology procurement tries to reduce risks like running over budget, over schedule or with insufficient functionality. It does this by trying to work harder: by working harder to determine requirements up-front, by being more prescriptive in terms of schedule and milestones, by being more strict in terms of certification for vendors to demonstrate competency and capability. The problem is, while the aim of all of those activities is admirable, they rarely (if ever) actually reduce risk.

The new Child Welfare Service is being thought of in terms of a long-term service, not a product that was going to be bought from, most likely, a single system integrator type vendor and then move in to a traditional &#8220;maintenance and operations&#8221; phase. This means it&#8217;s been broken up from a draft single RFP into smaller pieces of more focussed RFPs, each with a clear product vision, with a plan for California to take more of a lead role in directing and controlling how the Child Welfare Service evolves over time.

&#8230; and here&#8217;s a copy of the official notice from the procurement at the Office for Systems Integration:
