**What:**
  
Seven Code for America fellows are partnering with Azavea, a local web development firm, this Friday, and they are looking for everyone and anyone who’s interested in research, design, or software development to work on building a apps that leverage city data to improve citizens’ quality of life. DataCamp Philly is a one-day “hackathon” focused on bringing together local civic-minded technologists to solve a local problem.

The Friday event is all about building a network as much as it’s about building applications. It’s a one day snapshot of the entire one-year Code for America fellowship program. The fellows will moderate a mini research, design and build cycle, based on skills and practices that attendees want to learn more about. The product is a real live application that solves a Philadelphia specific issue.

“This is a chance to come together and build something that matters,”. Pete Fecteau, one of the 2011 Code for America fellows stated, adding “What’s cool is that we all walk away with something tangible”.

To show what can be done in just a few hours, the Code for America team will demo an application built on February 18th by a handful of fellows and local developers. The DataCamp will use this as a model to create a simple but valuable app using Philadelphia city data.

The group of seven have been in Philly since the start of February and have been working with the Department of Technology and others in City Hall, including Mayor Michael Nutter himself. John Mertens said “I guess we shouldn’t be surprised by the level of participation the City has given us. Everyone from the very top down is excited to work with us”. Mertens went on to stress the need for Philadelphia natives to get involved with the project.

The fellows are inviting the public, not just coders, to join them and Azavea staff in building an application based around civic data. That could range from a map of where trees are planted to a list of restaurant inspections. While you may think some data seems trivial and useless beyond government, the Code for America team wants you to come and see how it’s being turned into beautiful and highly functional tools citizens can use daily.
