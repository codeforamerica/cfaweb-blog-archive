excerpt: "Today is a day to celebrate the special people in  your life. For us at Code for America, we realize that sometimes we speak a different language than most: Hallmark cards don't tend to come in 1's and 0's. So we figured today we'd show our fellow geeks some love and help you all show some love. Enjoy and share some nerdy valentines made by our fellows."
