In case you are wondering, there are still people working on [symbol sketches](http://iconathon.org/symbols) &#8211; this is just the beginning of the volunteer effort, and we will continue to update the symbol gallery with all of the newly finished symbols.

To date, Iconathon has produced more than 100 finished sketches, 40 of which were refined after the Iconathon events were over. This involved hours and hours of very detailed computer work by an army of skilled designers and coordination by NounProject&#8217;s Co-founder Edward Boatman, who helped ensure that new symbols were congruent with all of the others already produced.

### Icon Camps!

What&#8217;s even cooler than this [new symbol suite](http://codeforamerica.org/2011/10/18/civic-symbol-suite-40-new-icons-for-the-public-domain/)? We now have an &#8220;open source&#8221; process for creating symbols. Anyone can more easily organize an &#8220;[Icon Camp](http://iconathon.org/host-an-icon-camp)&#8221; to create new symbols that are needed in our communities.

Great symbols are the product of bringing together passionate citizens, designers, and knowledgeable persons to sketch, talk, and design these powerful new images. The process makes it possible &#8212; it is essential that we work together.

We are determining how and when we will do another nationwide Iconathon next year, so follow @Iconathon, @nounproject, and @codeforamerica to stay up to date, and let us know if you want to be involved next year.

### A special thank you

I would like to extend an extra special thank you to Edward Boatman for leading the follow-up effort, and working with all of the designers after the Iconathon events ended. His skill, expertise, patience, and encouragement in designing symbols inspired, motivated, and empowered us designers to give back to our communities in our own special way.

I would also like to extend a special thank you to Karla Macedo (Code for America) and Sofya Polyakov (NounProject) for our partnership in creating and producing the Iconathon, and their amazing team work.

Iconathon is a movement, and it would not have happened without the participation of literally hundreds of people who we have met this year, and who support the vision of Code for America. So thank you tremendously, and enjoy your new symbols.
