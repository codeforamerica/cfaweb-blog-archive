Last weekend, thousands of people turned out to #hackforchange at 123 events in 103 communities around the world. We&#8217;re so excited that 47 of the events were organized by Code for America Brigades!

As the stories, accomplishments, and numbers from the weekend roll in, we wanted share the below Storify to giveÂ a brief snapshot of what happened in the Code for America network over the weekend. Even this brief survey of events shows some amazing results including the signing of an open data executive order, cross-city collaboration on apps, and much, much more.

<span style="font-size: 16px;">We&#8217;re so inspired by the energy, creativity, and hard work #hackforchange organizers and participants brought to the weekend. Thank you for coming out and using your time and skills to #hackforchange.</span>
