FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:
  
Code for America Opens Applications for 2012 Fellowship, Launches Early Decision Program

San Francisco, CA – March 15, 2011 – Code for America is now accepting applications for its [2012 Fellowship Program](http://www.codeforamerica.org/fellows/), announced technologist [Tim O’Reilly](http://blogs.forbes.com/davidewalt/2011/03/11/tim-oreilly-speaks-at-sxsw/) during an opening session of last week’s South by Southwest conference (SxSW). The CfA Fellowship, which connects web-industry talent with city governments for a year of public service, is seeking developers, researchers, entrepreneurs, and designers to apply for the 2012 program. Early decision applications are due April 15, 2011, and regular applications are due August 1, 2011.

The 2012 cycle will be the second year of the fellowship program. Last year, over 350 applications were received for the 20 spots in the inaugural fellowship, and competition is expected to be even stiffer this year since Code for America is introducing an early decision program to encourage new university graduates to apply. The early decision program will allow applicants to be notified of their acceptance into the program by May 1, 2011, an attractive prospect to graduating college seniors eager to solidify post-graduate plans. “With unprecedented volunteerism rates and the increasing popularity of technical skills, we believe there’s a wealth of undergraduate talent eager to code for America,” said Abhi Nemani, Code for America’s Director of Strategy and Communications. “The CfA fellowship is an ideal way for a recent graduate to jumpstart their career while giving back.”

Applicants selected as Code for America fellows for the 11-month 2012 program will receive a living-wage stipend, travel expenses, and healthcare, as well as the training and support to be positioned as a leader in business and public service. Benefits of participation include networking with industry and civic leaders like Tim O’Reilly, leadership training from negotiation expert David Eaves, guaranteed interviews at cutting-edge internet companies, and experience in a fast-paced, creative, and fun startup environment.

The deadline for early decision applications is April 15, 2011, and the regular decision deadline is August 1, 2011.
