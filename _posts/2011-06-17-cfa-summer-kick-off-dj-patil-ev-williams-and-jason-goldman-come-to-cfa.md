Last week, CfA kicked off its summer internship program with two notable visits: [DJ Patil](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/dj-patil), Chief of Product at Color, and [Ev Williams](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/evan-williams) and [Jason Goldman](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/jason-goldman) formerly of Twitter. Both talks offered unique insights about technology, entrepreneurship, and social change.

Williams and Goldman talked briefly about their start-up experiences &#8212; at Blogger, Twitter, etc. &#8212; and then answered questions from the CfA team about the inner workings of Twitter and advice for the fellowship program. In sum, we came away with useful and interesting ideas to apply to our summer efforts at CfA.
