We added an Anti-Harassment Policy to accompany our [Code of Conduct](http://www.codeforamerica.org/blog/2014/05/31/code-for-americas-code-of-conduct/ "Code for America’s Code of Conduct") for use at Code for America network events. [You can read both of them on GitHub](https://github.com/codeforamerica/codeofconduct "Code for America Code of Conduct and Anti-Harassment Policy"), for easy editing and engagement. If you think of worthy changes, please submit them as issues.

This policy is based on the example policy from the [Geek Feminism wiki](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Policy), created by the [Ada Initiative](http://adainitiative.org/) and other volunteers. To help Brigades and other network partners put it into practice, we also developed a [guide for using the Anti-Harassment Policy](https://docs.google.com/a/codeforamerica.org/document/d/1Zg2FDt7awgfCmdcbzMwKHMb1A7KDOhs_z7ibCb3TLLQ/edit).

Bringing people together to collaborate on building solutions for a wide range of civic problems is central to the work we do at Code for America. As we do that work, we have a responsibility to make sure those spaces are safe and welcoming for everyone. The Anti-Harassment Policy is an important resource that can help everyone be full and active participants without fear of harassment at Code for America events.

Our Anti-Harassment Policy and Code of Conduct are a response to our examination of our power and responsibility in the civic space and the technology industry. As we work with you to build bridges between people and their governments, we&#8217;re trying to understand how we can transform both civic practice and technology according to our values. It has to work for everyone.

We&#8217;d love to hear what you think about them. If you have thoughts or feedback on the policies please make a comment on the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/codeforamerica/codeofconduct).
