The [Code for America network](http://www.codeforamerica.org/brigade/) is made up of more than 16,000 people around the world who help make their communities and governments work better. Here&#8217;s a brief snapshot of what happened across the network this week:

### Play Your Favorite Tunes in Boston&#8217;s City Hall Using #CityHallJukeBox

As Boston municipal employees sift through various proposal ideas for <a href="http://bostinno.streetwise.co/2015/03/09/boston-city-hall-plaza-redesign-mayor-walsh-opens-request-for-ideas-submissions/" target="_blank">re-imagining City Hall Plaza</a>, the <a href="http://bostinno.streetwise.co/2014/12/17/what-is-the-new-urban-mechanics-boston-parking-projects/" target="_blank">Mayor&#8217;s Office of New Urban Mechanics</a> wants to hear your favorite song in City Hall. To activate the jukebox, tweet your favorite musical artist using [#CityHallJukeBox](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23CityHallJukeBox&src=typd) and an application linked directly to the music streaming service Spotify grabs one of the artist&#8217;s top most popular tracks and plays it in City Hall.

### Help Wanted

The civic tech movement needs your help!

  * Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf just released a proposed budget for 2015-17. Open Oakland helped make it [easy to understand](http://openbudgetoakland.org/) by publishing visualizations that explore the budget. Open Oakland still needs help getting more data. Live in Oakland? Encourage your council member to use the [Open Budget Proposal Template](http://speakupoakland.org/forums/improve-engagement-around-the-city-budget/ideas/apples-to-apples-help-us-build-a-tool-to-compare-budget-proposals), a standard format to share budget proposal data that would allow side-by-side comparison of Oakland&#8217;s budget options for the first time.
  * Have some time and want to help [Open Elections](http://openelections.net/)? Check out their [open Github issues](http://openelections.net/).
  * Help the [US Census Bureau](http://uscensusbureau.github.io/citysdk/) create a toolbox for civic hackers to connect local and national public data.
