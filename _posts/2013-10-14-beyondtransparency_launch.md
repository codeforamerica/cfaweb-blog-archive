[<img class="alignleft" alt="" src="http://www.codeforamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Screen-Shot-2013-10-14-at-10.30.25-PM.png" />](http://beyondtransparency.org)Today we&#8217;re excited to release _Beyond Transparency: Open Data and the Future of Civic Innovation,_ — an anthology of essays about open civic data, edited by Brett Goldstein (Former Chief Data officer of the City of Chicago) with Code for America.

_Beyond Transparency_ is, as [Waldo Jaquith](http://waldo.jaquith.org/about/) called it, &#8220;the first history of the open data movement&#8221; — written by practitioners, for practitioners. The book features essays from more than twenty of the world’s leading experts in a first-of-its-kind instructive anthology about how open data is changing the face of our public institutions. Through these stories, we examine what is needed to build an ecosystem in which open data can become the raw materials to drive more effective decision-making and efficient service delivery, spur economic activity, and empower citizens to take an active role in improving their own communities. Featuring open data leaders like New York&#8217;s Chief Analytics Officer Michael Flowers, GTFS creator Bibiana McHugh, and Knight Foundation&#8217;s John Bracken — the book is a testament to what can be achieved when communities, governments, and systems work together.

Here&#8217;s what people have to say about _Beyond Transparency_ so far:

> “Just as he did during his time in my administration, Goldstein has brought together industry leaders to discuss issues of relevance in the open data movement and the practical implications of implementing these policies…[T]his book will help continue the work to make Open Government a reality across the country.”

> “A must-read for anyone who is passionate about what open data can do to transform city living.”

> “As an essential volume for anyone interested in the future of governance, urban policy, design, data-driven policymaking, journalism, or civic engagement, “Beyond Transparency” combines the inspirational glow and political grit of Profiles in Courage with the clarity of an engineer’s calm explanation of how something technical actually works. Here are the detailed how-to stories of many members of the first generation of open government pioneers, written in a generous, accessible style; this compilation presents us with a great deal to admire, ample provocation, and wise guidance from a group of remarkable individuals.”
