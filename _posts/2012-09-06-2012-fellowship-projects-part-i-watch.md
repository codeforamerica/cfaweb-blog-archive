At our first-ever Fellowship Projects webinar, three of our 2012 fellows shared an in-depth look at projects they&#8217;ve been building this year and had a chance to answer live questions from our audience: [Textizen](http://www.textizen.com/welcome), [OpenCounter](http://opencounter.org/santacruz/), and [LocalData](http://golocaldata.com/). Watch the full recording below to find out the answers to audience questions like:

  * How did Textizen, built for Philadelphia, get redeployed in Salt Lake City and the City of Boston? **[(17:08)](https://vimeo.com/48826141#t=1035)**
  * How did Ruthie, a fellow on team Santa Cruz, Calif., decide to focus on business permitting for her project, and what has it been like working with the Planning Department? **[(31:33)](https://vimeo.com/48826141#t=1897)**
  * How hard is it to redeploy LocalData? Can a non-technical community organizer do it? **[(41:40)](https://vimeo.com/48826141#t=2501)**
  * How can someone in Albuquerque, N.M. — or anyone, anywhere — bring Code for America projects to their city? **[(50:48)](https://vimeo.com/48826141#t=3050)**

We&#8217;ll be livestreaming Part II of our Fellowship Projects webinar series, featuring three more apps from this year&#8217;s fellowship, at 10 a.m. Pacific (1 p.m. Eastern) on September 18, 2012: [RSVP now](http://cfa2012webinar.eventbrite.com).
