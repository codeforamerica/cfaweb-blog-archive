Everyday, we get the privilege of reading a new application for our fellowship program, and we see first-hand the passion and enthusiasm among citizens from across the country to give back and make a difference. This is rewarding work. Just as rewarding, though, is the opportunity to share our candidates&#8217; stories with the diverse, knowledgeable, and experienced group on our Fellow Selection Committee. Ranging from entrepreneurs like Jake Nickell, Anil Dash, and Micki Krimmel to expert technologists like Irene Au, Matt Knox, and Margeigh Novotny, dozens have stepped up to help us take on the important and challenging work of selecting the best possible class of fellows for 2012.

And it won&#8217;t be easy. We have already received over a hundred applications for our [2012 fellowship](http://codeforamerica.org/fellows), and with our [Early Decision](http://codeforamerica.org/fellows/apply) deadline around the corner &#8212; [Friday, April 15, so get your applications in!](http://codeforamerica.org/fellows/apply) &#8212; we expect even more. We will rely on the committee&#8217;s judgement and insight to help us make the tough choices and put together a class that can and will make us proud.
