Last week, [Good Magazine featured](http://www.good.is/post/part-peace-corps-part-venture-capital-code-for-america-s-plan-for-public-innovation/) the launch of our [Civic Startup Accelerator](/accelerator), which prompted a bunch of tweets &#8212; mostly supportive, some curious, but [one](http://twitter.com/ChaseAdam17/status/201326802189291520) however caught my eye:

    Peace Corps meets VC meets Silicon Valley. But why not just work for a startup? <a href="http://t.co/5hi9uKbu" title="http://bit.ly/Js0TH5">bit.ly/Js0TH5</a>

Basically it&#8217;s the question why a civic startup and not just a traditional one&#8230; I have actually gotten this question a couple of times, and it&#8217;s nontrivial. Particularly with the staggering level of activity in the consumer web, why take on the often times daunting notion of the [civic web](http://codeforamerica.org/2012/01/09/kevin-curry-why-im-coding-for-america/)? 

So I figured I&#8217;d ask the people actually doing it. I turned to a few civic entreprenuers who have graciously agreed to be mentors for our Accelerator to describe their motivation and rationale for working in this space:

Ryan Alfred ([@ryanalfred](http://twitter.com/ryanalfred)), co-founder, [BrightScope](http://brightscope.com):

> Startups are very personal. Usually successful founders are tackling unsolved problems that matter to them personally. A civic startup is nothing more than a startup founded by entrepreneurs who noticed that our government has some huge issues, and who believe that a startup is a better and more accessible platform than politics to solve these issues. 

Steve Ressler ([@govloop](http://twitter.com/govloop)), founder, [GovLoop](http://govloop.com):

> As Tim O&#8217;Reilly said &#8220;Do something that matters.&#8221; Civic startups have big markets, less competition, and huge problems with more meaning (improve lives of citizens VS another fart app). 
> 
> There is no better time to work in a civic startup &#8212; with decreasing budgets and increased government data, government is ripe for disruption and more receptive than ever to new innovative solutions to civic problems.

For anyone else working on a civic startup or initiative, we&#8217;d love to hear why you&#8217;re up for it. Share your responses in the comments, and don&#8217;t forget that the deadline for applications for the inaugural [CfA Accelerator](http://codeforamerica.org/accelerator) is rapidly approached (**June 1**).
