During our last Labs Friday, [Andrew Sliwinski](http://www.thisandagain.com/) led an [Arduino](http://www.arduino.cc/) workshop at the CfA office. Arduino is an electronic prototyping platform that allows even amateur hackers (like me) to create cool, interactive electronic objects. From blinking lights (Arduino&#8217;s version of &#8220;Hello world&#8221;) to wireless air climate sensors, there was something to learn for beginners and experts alike. It was a great time of enjoyment and feeling like a kid again. After a little bit of hacking on my own part, I put together a quick James Bond-inspired music video to capture the event. Check it out:
