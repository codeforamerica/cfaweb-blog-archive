Meet Amir.

Amir was a 2012 CfA Fellow who left the world of Wall Street to serve the City of New Orleans for a year. During the 2012 Fellowship Amir and his teammates worked with the City and the community of New Orleans to figure out a new, technological way to tackle the persistent issue of blight.
