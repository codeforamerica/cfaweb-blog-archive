Becki ([@beckiames](https://twitter.com/beckiames)) began her career with work on numerous state and national political campaigns before spending nearly a decade as a staffer in the California Legislature. Becki served as the Chief of Staff for Mayor Bob Foster for the past eight years. She is a mom, avid Boston sports fan, intrepid gardener & is launching a strategic consulting firm this fall.  Our current fellows in Long Beach constantly sing Becki&#8217;s praise as the one who helps get the job done. We recently talked with Becki about her work and her methods for ensuring a successful CfA Fellowship year.

### Chief of Staff job tasks can often fall under the ‘tasks to be assigned’ line item in a job description. In this way it’s just as ambiguous as the process of innovation, how do you navigate that ambiguity and prioritize?

It’s the job of any Chief of Staff to balance the urgent and important issues in order to create efficiencies with executive’s time. If tech is something to achieve those outcomes, by all means. Executives have to deal with everything that comes across their desk. Water mains burst, natural disasters approach, these are urgent problems requiring immediate attention. Mayors dealing with these urgent issues must stop what they’re doing to solve them. We always have to keep the big picture in mind. It&#8217;s important to maintain a place for innovation among the important.

### How do you balance building relationships with keeping everyone updated about what’s going on?

No one is successful by themselves, success is a bunch of people working together. Internally, staying in contact with the departments as the fellows&#8217; iterative process continues is important to keeping a sense of community. For the fellowship this year, over fifty city staffers have spoken to the fellows, these are people who believed in the project and the application of technology. The fellows tumblr page is very helpful, and everyone uses twitter. To reach the greater public we scheduled interviews with mainstream media and our community partner &#8211; The Molina Foundation did a [great event](http://www.molinafoundation.org/the-molina-foundation-brings-computer-programing-instruction-to-long-beach-middle-school/) with middle school children to share the fellow’s work and conduct a coding training for the kids. Another round of interviews based on the developments of the project are being organized now.

### How did you prepare for the fellows arrival in Long Beach?

We helped them understand what was important to us.  It’s important to invest time and energy in preparation for the onboarding month, the end result will benefit with from the focus of a project lead who begins on the first of the year. A productive and effective February will yield a great project.

When the fellows arrived for their 30 day residency in February there was no shortage of things to discuss or people to meet. CfA fellows are curious by nature but we needed to help them understand who to talk to and in what order, so they could easily create a holistic picture and not get caught in the weeds early on. Coordinating the meetings is important but we also provided the space for the fellows to take control of and guide their learning process. Dropping them on the ground is just inefficient, you need to be intentional with who they meet so it appropriately sets the stage for their next meeting. We made sure to constantly keep the fellows looking at the big picture throughout the process.

### Has the fellowship improved the sense of innovation in the city?

<p dir="ltr">
  We like to think we’re an innovative team, we have been embracing tech in Long Beach for some time now. But the fellows came in, assessed the tech based systems at play and identified some systems that might not have been applied very well or not designed quite right, they also provided other ways the existing tools could be impactful. The staff really appreciate the energy and excitement the fellows bring. I think that’s one of the most important outcomes &#8211; injecting excitement into divisions that might not normally get attention.
</p>

### How can you sustain that energy and excitement?

<p dir="ltr">
  That’s the $1 million dollar question. While administrative aspects of government are not exciting &#8211; and I&#8217;m not sure we want government administration to be exciting &#8211; other parts it should be, like change. We need to keep the legacy going, through the local brigade and others to sustain the cycle of rejuvenation.  Staying in touch is key through the duration of the fellowship program. They will need comments and direction, and might not even know they need it. Just being able to touch base, remaining open and available has been important to us, we try to talk on a weekly or biweekly basis.
</p>

### Can you apply lessons from the fellowship to other projects?

<p dir="ltr">
  Mayor Foster is a data and numbers guy, he has pushed aside the political interest and outcome and looked for the right ways to do stuff, nine out of ten times he used data to get there. This helped me, as a staffer, approach problems and get breathing room from the common political pressures, which can overtake substance. It’s great to have leadership support in this direction. Some things jump off the page &#8211; being able to employ data analytics to help people make policy decisions is one of the most important things we can do.
</p>

Open data is open data, that’s great and is its own thing; but to be able to have the time and portfolios to know what it means is very powerful.

<p dir="ltr">
  It is always fun when we would sit down with different departments to have a conversation about data sets. The first response is ‘you have to type it all into a computer? That’s not going work, we don’t have the resources for that’. Then you get to say, ‘don’t worry the app will do it for you’. You need to automate this process, to which the reaction is, ‘oh really?’ It’s like magic.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  Technologists and others within CfA have to be patient and understand that API’s and newer tech processes are not a natural place for government staff to go. If it was we wouldn’t have a need for CfA. The fact that CfA exists is a good thing.
</p>

### Any other advice for future City Partners?

<p dir="ltr">
  The Community Partner is key. The Molina Foundation has been very supportive and appreciative.
