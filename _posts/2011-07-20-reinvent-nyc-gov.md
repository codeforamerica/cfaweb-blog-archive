Last week, [New York City announced](http://www.govtech.com/wireless/Bloomberg-Web-Design-Ideas-NYCgov.html?elq=d02186c6bf7c49a9aec6d77ef230f0c9) its first ever hackathon aimed to revamp its web presence, NYC.gov. On July 30-31, teams of designers, developers, writers, photographers and product managers will gather at General Assembly in New York City and spend a weekend implementing their visions for a re-imagined NYC.gov. Mayor Michael Bloomberg announced the contest in which &#8220;civic participation will meet the digital age.&#8221; The idea for community involvement in the city website&#8217;s redesign came from the Mayor&#8217;s [“Road Map for the Digital City,”](https://docs.google.com/a/codeforamerica.org/viewer?url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/media/media/PDF/90dayreport.pdf) published in May.

Here are some more details about the hackathon:

  * Companies such as Facebook, Twitter, and Google will make their APIs available during the contest.
