I&#8217;ve been amazed by how useful municipal data can be. I&#8217;ve also been surprised by the disorganization of city data. When data is disorganized or inaccessible, cities become less transparent. Residents lose the benefits that the data and data-driven applications can provide.

My favorite example of the power of data transparency is Stamen Design&#8217;s [Oakland Crimespotting](http://oakland.crimespotting.org). It&#8217;s an incredibly useful application that helps Oakland residents research crime in their city. The problem was simple: Oakland residents did not have a complete picture of all of the crime in their neighborhoods. Despite Oakland&#8217;s history with high crime, the San Francisco Bay Area&#8217;s news outlets underreported crime in troubled neighborhoods. Moreover, the crime data was not easily [accessible](http://mike.teczno.com/notes/oakland-crime-maps/I.html) to residents. Stamen&#8217;s developers even had challenges obtaining a [reliable](http://mike.teczno.com/notes/oakland-crime-maps/X.html) data feed.

It&#8217;s important to break down the barriers between public data and citizens. Local agencies are some of our most prolific data gatherers. There is also a growing contingent of city officials who are passionate about opening public data. Code for America can be a missing link in providing platforms that make data accessible and easy to use.
