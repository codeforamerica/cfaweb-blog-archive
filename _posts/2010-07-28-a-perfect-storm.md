The Center for American Progress released [a report this week about Millennials&#8217; perception of government](http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2010/07/dww_millennials.html), calling this generation the &#8220;most pro-government.&#8221; Interestingly, that belief stemmed not from satisfaction in policy but from confidence in reform: Millennials believe that a robust government can and will be smarter, especially if it embraces new information technology.

> &#8220;The key lesson embedded in these seemingly paradoxical results is that people would rather improve government performance than reduce its size. They are extremely receptive to a reform agenda that would eliminate inefficient government programs, implement performance-based policy decisions, and adopt modern management methods and **information technologies**.&#8221; (emphasis mine)

This generation wants to keep government at the table, but seated in a desk chair, not a recliner.

This is why I think there&#8217;s been such great response to the [CfA Fellowship](http://codeforamerica.org/fellows) from Millennials. It comes at a time when government needs to change and people believe they can make that happen. It&#8217;s a perfect storm. We can catalyze increased volunteerism, modern efficiencies, and renewed confidence, all by connecting the dots between the Millennials&#8217; desire for service and change and politicians&#8217; interest in better government and, well, self-preservation. As the CAP report puts it, Millennials &#8220;hold the key to a new era of public confidence in governmentâ€š if public officials learn to spend taxpayers&#8217; dollars more carefully, and do what works.&#8221; In fact, a majority (67%) across generations shared this sentiment. And so in a way, CfAcan offer any city the chance to &#8220;[ask not](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLdA1ikkoEc),&#8221; and provide any citizen &#8212; young and old &#8212; an answer.
