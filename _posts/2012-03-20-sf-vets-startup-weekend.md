Join us next weekend for a first-of-its kind [Startup Veterans Hackathon](http://www.techcentralsf.com/startup-veterans/), hosted by TechCentralSF.

The TechCentralSF Startup Veteran weekend is a two-day business and app development competition. The event’s goal is to invite returning veterans to be part of a team focused on building successful startups around the next generation social, mobile, gaming, ecommerce, health, or other applications and to foster a community of (veteran) entrepreneurship. Our veterans can add a unique perspective to many of these types of applications. Winning teams get prizes ranging from tablet to free office space.
