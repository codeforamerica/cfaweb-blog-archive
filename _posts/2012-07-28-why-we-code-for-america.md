If you&#8217;ve been following our [facebook](http://www.facebook.com/codeforamerica) or [twitter](http://www.twitter.com/codeforamerica) streams recently, you have already learned that the CfA Fellows are a diverse bunch of tie-wearing (only on Tuesdays), coffee-loving, civic-minded individuals with an amazing ability to learn, share, and build.

When I asked some fellows why they chose to pursue a fellowship and &#8220;code&#8221; for America, they took to the twitterverse and with 140 characters declared their mission.

    Last week, you could actually see the dedication begin to spill over into paper and digital declarations. Zach Williams proudly displayed his commitment to open source project development. Liz Hunt found a black Sharpie and printer paper and told us about the only interface she thinks is worth hacking.

    Despite the many challenges fellows face throughout the year, each class discovers it takes a delicate balance between people and technology to tackle the issues of today. Continuing a legacy of citizenship and participation, Code for America fellows work to inject a culture of innovation and discussion around open data, civic apps, and community engagement.
