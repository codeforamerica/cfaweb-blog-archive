_It’s time to say thanks to the dedicated public servants that helped our Fellows navigate City Hall and champion our mission. And to the Cities that opened their doors, their minds, and their databases to the 2012 Fellows._

The 2012 Code for America Fellowship has come to a close and Team Chicago would like to thank our city partners John Tolva, Danielle Dumerer, and Dan X. O&#8217;Neil for all that we&#8217;ve learned from them this year.

From John, we learned how the principals and theory of transparent government can actually be put into practice. From Danielle, we learned how the hard, daily work of rewiring the legacy systems of a city is done. From Dan we learned how one can build a community of talented citizens who are motivated to help build a more open and efficient city government.

We are also thankful for all that we learned from the City of Chicago itself. Here are some pro tips:

  * Pretty much anything can become a hot dog if you really [believe](http://www.hotdougs.com)
  * No one chicagoan has the same opinion about where to find the best deep dish pizza but the correct answer is Gino&#8217;s East **<flamewar/>**
  * [Malört](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mal%C3%B6rt) is a thing and you can drink it (and probably live)

All of these things relate to Chicago&#8217;s gastronomic scene and that, dear reader, is how we wind our way back at the theme of this post: Chicago and Thanksgiving. The truth is that this is only a small taste (pun intended) of what the City has to offer and there are many lifetimes of lessons to be learned about food, open government, and so much more. As we reflect on and appreciate our experience, we wish the best to future fellows as they face new challenges and, hopefully, continue to build on the work we did in Chicago.
