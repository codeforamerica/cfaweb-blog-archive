The [City of Oakland](http://www2.oaklandnet.com/) is committed to open government, transparency, and innovation. We are currently seeking web-based solutions to break down cumbersome processes and emerge with better systems that will help us cut costs, increase productivity, and provide better service to the public.

The City will benefit immensely from the help of Code for America. Just having the Fellows here will help motivate us to:

  * Set up our infrastructure so that we are poised to fully take advantage of web 2.0—including Open Source applications and agile development methodologies.
  * Charter through an organizational culture shift by educating city staff and elected officials about the benefits of web-based solutions, open data, and collaborative frameworks.
  * Increase civic engagement and citizen’s access to Government services.
  * Evolve into a more open, streamlined and efficient government model.

The Bay Area is the tech hub of the world, and Oakland is the geographic and creative center of the Bay Area, so it is fitting that the cutting-edge innovations being incubated and launched locally could be applied to local government. The digital divide exists not just between low-income residents and those with financial means in our city, but between the public and private sectors. Ideally, public sector services could benefit from the same innovations that private sector products and services rely on for viability in the marketplace.

Oakland is a dynamic hub of innovation and visionary thinkers. We are proud to have creative, committed, and tech-savvy residents and community partners, as well as a great new administrative team that is eager for change and committed to leveraging the power of apps, emerging technology, and the web.

Like most government agencies facing diminished resources, we can no longer afford to do business as usual. Over the past five years we have lost nearly a quarter of our staff. Despite the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, the City is now seeing modest growth. We want to continue on the path towards economic stabilization, but we realize that it will require an investment in tools that will help us better engage with citizens, increase efficiency, and make more informed decisions.

We are excited to develop a relationship with Code for America that will extend beyond the fellowship. From the [Brigade](http://brigade.codeforamerica.org/) to the new [accelerator program](http://codeforamerica.org/accelerator/), we are ready to engage and emerge as a better City with the help of Code for America.
