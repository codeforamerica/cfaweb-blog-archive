In celebration of our nation&#8217;s birthday, we offer you this 2.0 take on the Liberty Bell.



_What is this?_ Two of the 2012 fellows, Prashant Singh and Nick Dorion, did a bit of hardware and software hacking to make a Liberty Bell that rang whenever a fellow posted new code on [Github](http://github.com/codeforamerica) &#8212; it&#8217;s kind of like a patriotic spin on [Talin Salway&#8217;s coder sounds from 2011](http://codeforamerica.org/2011/04/26/github-pushes-screaming-hawks-and-a-culture-of-collaboration/).

If you want to make cool things too, apply for a 2014 Code for America Fellowship: <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/apply" target="_blank">http://codeforamerica.org/apply</a>.

**Happy Birthday, America.**
