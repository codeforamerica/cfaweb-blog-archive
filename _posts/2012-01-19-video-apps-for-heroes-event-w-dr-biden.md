Yesterday Code for America played host to the Apps for Heroes event where various tech industry companies demonstrated their wares for Second Lady Dr. Jill Biden and United States Chief Technology Officer Aneesh Chopra. Companies such as Fidelis and JIBE explained the applications they have built to aid our country&#8217;s service members&#8217; transition to the civilian workforce.

During the event Dr. Biden reminded us all that she herself is an military wife and that &#8220;we all have a role to play in supporting our military.&#8221;

Dr. Biden went on to say,Â &#8220;You are a great example of what we want to ask all Americans to do. As innovators&#8230;you find new and creative ways to solve problems. Thank you for unleashing your tremendous creativity in support of our service members.&#8221;
