On September 6 at MIT we are organizing an Open &#8220;Hack Day&#8221; to launch a Code for America project, [CityGroups](http://codeforamerica.org/?cfa_project=citygroups), for the city of Boston. CityGroups is a public directory of community groups. CityGroups makes it easier to find those little, super-local community organizations that work to make our cities better. 

### Features

  * A public directory of community groups.
  * Groups listed with email or url, geographic information (a shape) & tags
  * API & Imports CSV. Working on round trip syncing and outputting data to other databases.
  * Data collection projects. For example, for Seattle we are reaching out to Block Watch Captains, to map all of the Block Watch Captains in a neighborhood. For Boston, it would be possible to reach out to all of the biking organizations, or various other community groups.

### The Open Hack Day

We invite community organizers, Drupalistas, open government advocates and interested citizens to this Open Hack Day.
  
The goal of the day (and of the whole week of Sept 4-9) is to launch this application as a community, and to continue the development of the software, in a social way. The ideas is that community members can become better technologists by being involved in a tool that is actually helpful to their everyday work in making Boston a great place to live, work & learn. [Calagator](http://calagator.wordpress.com/) is an example of a project that was very social. [Let&#8217;s](http://tasks.citygroups.org/) to do that!

### Goals of the Sprint Week: September 4 &#8211; 9, 2011

1. Get CityGroups up and running for Boston.
  
2. Get some community groups into the system. (We have at least one database to start with, but can use some more!)
  
3. Identify a few initial data collection projects & write invitations. (Ex. reaching out to education related groups, bicycling organizations, or other groups that work to make Boston better.)
  
4. Draft a strategy for making CityGroups useful to Boston.
  
5. Discuss opportunities to keep the project running in Boston.
