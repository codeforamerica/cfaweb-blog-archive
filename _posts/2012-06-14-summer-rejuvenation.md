The interns have arrived.

They&#8217;re full of energy and enthusiasm - and great ideas. During their first week we told them all about Code for America, and they told us about their adventures making their way out to San Francisco.

It seems they&#8217;ve arrived at the perfect time to infuse some energy into the office. Summer&#8217;s beginning and we&#8217;re about half way through the fellowship &#8212; needless to say, fresh perspectives and new faces are a great way to rejuvenate the fellows and the staff for a summer chock-full of apps to build, campaigns to run, blogs to write, events to host &#8212; the list goes on, and on, and on.

They&#8217;ll be here until August 10, so stay tuned &#8211; they&#8217;ll be up to some very interesting things.

**Welcome Rob, Joey, Stephen, Hannah, Anne, Michelle, Ariel, Phillip, Matt, and Sam.** **We&#8217;re glad you&#8217;re here.**
