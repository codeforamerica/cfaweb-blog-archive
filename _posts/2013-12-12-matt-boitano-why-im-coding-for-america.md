I guess I’m the sort of person who tends to enjoy things that other people hate. For example, when I told friends and family that I was a Politics major in college, they tended to wrinkle their faces and grimace. Similarly, now when I proclaim that I have a calling in nonprofit fundraising, people look mortified, like I told them that my favorite food was cardboard. “Who is this weirdo,” I can hear them saying behind my back, “and why would he be interested in fundraising?”

But I firmly believe that those three subjects &mdash; politics, fundraising and technology &mdash; are not obstacles, but platforms that can be seamlessly integrated in the pursuit of social change, and that everyone can participate in such a movement.

Let’s start with my pessimistic parents. When they think of tech, their minds immediately jump to the blue screen of death, the printer that refuses to print wirelessly, and the interminable customer support phone calls with no productive result. That is part of the world of tech, but it’s not everything, not even close. Tech can be anything you want it to be &mdash; from the silly cat Youtube video to an organization like Wikileaks &mdash; and that’s why it’s a platform.

Politics is the same way. Many people in this country decry politics as simply bitter squabbling between incompetent politicians, but we can also view politics as a platform through which citizens can inspire new approaches to the delivery of services. This framing has the potential to influence everything from healthcare to criminal justice, and such optimism is part of my mentality at CfA. Through our fellowships and hackathons, CfA empowers citizens to work with government to simplify processes and make smart tools.

Now, I know what you’re thinking: &#8220;I don’t know how to code, I barely understand how to copy and paste!” Well, neither do I. But everyone has a role to play in a movement, and that’s where fundraising comes in for me. Fundraising is a platform because it allows organizations to interact with the community in a variety of different ways. While some see fundraising as a painful, pass-the-hat around the church annoyance, new approaches like crowdfunding can inspire, empower, and excite donors to support what they deem to be important.

So that’s why I’m coding for America. Here’s the secret: you don’t have to know how to code to code for America. Everyone has a role to play in a movement.
