<p dir="ltr">
  I Code for America because I believe in praxis. Praxis, as I loosely define it with all apologies to Marx, is the process of putting theory into practice. For a long time I&#8217;ve been dissatisfied with the path of my career. For all of my working life, I have worked on piecemeal projects. Start a project, produce deliverables, get paid. Nothing more, nothing less. I think there&#8217;s more than that.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  I live in inner city neighborhood plagued with stray dog packs, houses in disrepair, graffiti, drug dealing, and prostitution. As a technologist, I saw technical solutions to many of these problems. I&#8217;ve seen implementations of <a href="http://open311.org/">Open311</a> and <a href="http://seeclickfix.com/">See, Click, Fix</a> in other cities; and I&#8217;ve participated in projects such as <a href="http://treekit.org/">TreeKit</a>, a citizen census, and mapping of trees in New York City. I want to build and implement these ideas in my city, but lack an understanding the process of change.
</p>

So I Code for America for selfish reasons.  I want my neighbors to have the power to make the changes we talk about in neighborhood meetings. I want the interfaces to government to be transparent and open. I think that Code for America will provide the tools to build the connection between citizens and government. I want praxis.
