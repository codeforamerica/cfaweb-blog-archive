    We're so excited to have a bunch of new faces in the office: summer interns! Last week, over a dozen new recruits joined Code for America to work on projects ranging from design and code to policy and outreach -- thanks in no small part to the support of <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/2011/03/28/cfa-google-summer-of-code/">Google Summer of Code</a> and the other organizations that made this program possible for the students.

Last week, over a dozen new recruits joined Code for America to work on projects ranging from design and code to policy and outreach &#8212; thanks in no small part to the support of [Google Summer of Code](http://codeforamerica.org/2011/03/28/cfa-google-summer-of-code/) and the other organizations that made this program possible for the students. They kicked off the internship last week with a mini-CfA Training, with trainings on government and technology, and throughout the summer, they&#8217;ll receive mentorship and support from our fellows and advisors.

We&#8217;re very excited to see what this terrific, diverse, and talented class can do. For now, as the summer is just getting started, we&#8217;re pleased to introduce you to the 2011 CfA Summer Interns:

### 2011 CfA Summer Interns

  <img src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Chris-Barna.jpg" border="0" alt="" align="left" /><strong>Chris Barna</strong> is studying political science and math at Santa Clara University. He is passionate about open government and open data, and has experience building useful applications both inside and outside government. In Fall 2010, he interned with the FCC&#8217;s new media team helping with the FCC.gov redesign project, which has been widely regarded as the standard bearer for modern government websites. But when he&#8217;s not programming in Javascript, PHP, Ruby, or Python, you can probably find him playing alto saxophone or reading. This summer, he&#8217;ll join the team working on the Open311 Dashboard.&nbsp;</p>
