I’ve had the good fortune to see life through a series of personal experiments over the past decade, occasionally learning a few things along the way. At one point it was co-organizing a music and art performance space while working in a shipping department. Later, it was drumming with a crafty rock band, touring the country. Somehow, I then transitioned to growing a software consultancy with a great group of dweebs in Chicago. For the last couple of years I worked from home, except that I relocated to a new home in a new city every month or two.

The results of these experiments are hard to summarize without a major, major book deal, but one particular lesson stands out. When I surround myself with great people &#8212; challenging, supportive people &#8212; serendipity follows. Novel ideas emerge to the benefit of all involved. Perhaps another lesson I’ve learned is that the best way to apply good ideas is in the service of others. Positive contribution to the social fabric is among the most time-tested ways to find happiness and meaning.

The crucial role that social-connectedness plays in well-being is generally understood. What’s less certain is whether technology can strengthen these real life bonds. We all find technology alienating at times when we face harsh, broken experiences that seem to disregard or sometimes [disdain](https://medium.com/p/47434acb50a8) us. But it is ultimately a tool, the key is how we wield it. Which is why I’m coding for America, to experiment with the use of technology as a means to empathize and connect. If we bring a deep focus to the actual people involved, we can build better tools with benefits that resonate well beyond their initial vision.
