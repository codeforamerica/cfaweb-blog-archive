The Code for America model relies on making connections &#8212; connections between governments wanting change and passionate citizens able to deliver it. These are connections that too often go unmade, but we&#8217;re working to change that. Our fellowship connects talented web professionals with city governments to solve core problems, and now we&#8217;re partnering with [FutureGov](http://wearefuturegov.com/) and [Simpl](http://simpl.co) to get more people in on the game, to make it easier, quicker, and &#8212; well &#8212; simpler for cities great ideas to partner with people who can make them happen.

It&#8217;s called [Social Innovation Speed Dating](http://simplcfasf.eventbrite.com). And it&#8217;s an event where we open up our SF offices to citizens and city officials with ideas, skills, or resources looking for a match; they go around the room, playing the field, seeing what&#8217;s out there for a partnership; and by the end of night, they walk away with <del>numbers</del> &#8212; er, email addresses and business cards. It&#8217;s actually just how it sounds: speed dating but for civic problem-solving. And not to worry, we&#8217;ll have snacks and drinks to ease things along.

**Who should come?** You might be a government employee with great ideas, a social innovator or a San Francisco resident looking to make change happen. Ideally you&#8217;ll have either a problem that you&#8217;re looking for help to take on or skills and resources you can bring to bear.

**What kinds of problems?** It can be anything ranging from &#8220;I wish there was a web app for that form&#8221; to &#8220;I think the city should have a better way to engage citizens&#8221; or even an idea for a new non-profit or start-up.

**What do you need to bring to the table?** Anything really. Technical skills, desk space, a spare monitor, or just some free time. Even if you think you don&#8217;t have anything to offer, come and talk to a few people, and you&#8217;ll quickly realize that you do.

Fortunately, FutureGov, run by friend of CfA, Dominic Campbell, has run a few of these events with great success ([check out coverage](http://www.simpl.co/blog/2010/10/27/social-innovation-matchmaking-comes-to-washington-dc/) of their Social Speed Dating in DC), and we&#8217;re looking forward to working with them to make [Speed Dating SF](simplcfasf.eventbrite.com) a success.
