_The following is a guest post from Steve Ressler of <a title="GovLoop" href="http://www.govloop.com/" target="_blank">GovLoop</a>:_

Have you heard of <a title="dataMontgomery" href="https://data.montgomerycountymd.gov/" target="_blank">dataMontgomery</a>? It’s Montgomery County, Maryland’s open data portal that gives citizens, business owners and other government departments the opportunity to review and analyze raw data. It also highlights county services and enables residents to see exactly how their money is being spent. Montgomery County is a great example for open data innovation and government financial transparency, but certainly not the only one.

What about <a title="Fairfax County, Virginia Police Events" href="http://www.fairfaxcounty.gov/policeevents/" target="_blank">Fairfax County, Virginia’s Police Events Application</a>? This app allows county residents to search and map police service calls, and access preliminary police investigation data from Fairfax County’s 911 call center, with an easy-to-use GIS search engine. It also makes it easier for the county’s Department of Information Technology to answer complex queries to meet citizen demands (think: finding the needle in the haystack significantly quicker).

As these two examples show, all across the country we are seeing innovative practices to improve how government operates. From new citizen engagement strategies and mobile apps to doing more with less, state and local governments are continuously finding solutions to really tough issues. Unfortunately, these success stories are often overshadowed. But that’s where GovLoop comes in!

On **Wednesday, October 22nd** we are hosting a FREE all-day <a title="State and Local Innovators Virtual Summit" href="http://direct.govloop.com/State-Local-Virtual-Summit" target="_blank">virtual summit</a> to highlight how state and local governments are leveraging technology and tackling challenges in a proactive, inventive, and agile way.

We’ve even assembled a panel of government leaders to share their tips for rising the ranks in government.
