It&#8217;s platform day at the Code for America institute.  As we approach city projects, how can we ensure they are open, create &#8216;more value than they capture&#8217; and involve the larger technology/civic community?  Speakers included Tim O&#8217;Reilly from O&#8217;Reilly Media, [Lesa Mitchell](http://twitter.com/#!/lesamitchell) from [Kauffman Foundation](http://www.kauffman.org) and [Danielle Morrill](http://twitter.com/#!/timoreilly) from [It&#8217;s platform day at the Code for America institute.  As we approach city projects, how can we ensure they are open, create &#8216;more value than they capture&#8217; and involve the larger technology/civic community?  Speakers included Tim O&#8217;Reilly from O&#8217;Reilly Media, [Lesa Mitchell](http://twitter.com/#!/lesamitchell) from [Kauffman Foundation](http://www.kauffman.org) and [Danielle Morrill](http://twitter.com/#!/timoreilly) from](http://www.startupweekend.com) and [Twilio](http://www.twilio.com).

What makes a platform brilliant? Tim O&#8217;Reilly suggests platforms have the following characteristics:

<div>
  <ol id="internal-source-marker_0.8690056568011642">
    <li>
      Platforms spread when they are ubiquitous and barriers to entry are low.
    </li>
    <li>
      Communications oriented. Strong platforms establish and document the rules of communication early so that all members know how to communicate with each other.
    </li>
    <li>
      Rules should create an architecture of participation.  Participation is easy with simple elements.
    </li>
    <li>
      Platforms establish clearly defined boundaries (an api) with clearly defined extensions layers (third-party apps).
    </li>
    <li>
      Extending the platform is simple with permissionless extensibility.
    </li>
    <li>
      Platforms are  “open enough”
    </li>
    <li>
      Simple solutions allow for incredible evolution.
    </li>
    <li>
      Big point: people should be able to innovate on top of your platform without ever consulting you.
    </li>
    <li>
      Successul platforms drive using data. &#8220;If Google were a restaurant, they would be photographing the plates.
    </li>
  </ol>

      Danielle Morrill shared some of the success behind building two organizations. First, <a href="http://www.startupweekend.com">Startup Weekend</a> is a 54-hour warrior weekend event hosted in 100+ cities across the world.  Second, Danielle has been instrumental in coordinating the  25,000+ developer community behind <a href="http://www.twilio.com">Twilio&#8217;s</a> API platform.  Danielle shared her thoughts on tactics, practices and methods behind building strong local communities&#8211;some interesting highlights include:

    People joins lots of communities, but they stay in the ones that help meet selfish reasons. They need a personal return (even if only satisfaction).  Those feeling the most benefit will be the ones that maintain the community, especially through hard times. Finding organizers in local communities is key.

    Often, an ask for them is also a give.  By asking them to help bring an opportunity to their community, you&#8217;re also giving them an opportunity.  Also, weekly structured engagements are key, not just for marketing and community building, but to keep staff agile in maintaining/thinking about community relationships.  When providing incentives for participation, don&#8217;t give out items that people already have, give out things that are extras (Kindle over a MacBook).
