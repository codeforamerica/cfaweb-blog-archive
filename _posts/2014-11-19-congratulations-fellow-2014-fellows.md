This year was a lot of hard work. As just one of the 30 amazing 2014 fellows, I can say it was one of the most challenging and rewarding experiences I’ve done. Through our combined passion, dedication, and talents, I believe we have made a small, yet lasting, impact on the governments we partnered with.

But it was also one of the most fun and silly and whimsical years of my life. At Code for America, we have a strong culture of celebration and appreciation, and the fellows are at the heart of creating a fun and supportive environment. From dance breaks and crosshacks, to bike adventures and piñata parties, to juggling lessons and high fives, the fellows helped create an office culture that made me excited to come to work every day and tackle big, important challenges.

That culture doesn’t happen overnight. It takes work too. I hope you enjoy a slice of greatest hits of it from this year.

Congratulations everyone!
