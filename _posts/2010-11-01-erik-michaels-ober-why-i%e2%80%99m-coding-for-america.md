Despite my interest in public service, I&#8217;ve spent my entire career working with technology startups in the private sector. This decision was mostly a pragmatic one. When I graduated from college, I had no savings and lots of debt. Computer programming was my most employable skill. While I&#8217;ve enjoyed the work I&#8217;ve done and lessons I&#8217;ve learned over the past five years, I&#8217;d like to apply that knowledge and experience to serve my country.
