We officially kicked off the redesign of the Code for America website in September 2013. At that point, we had already started making changes to our old site’s content and information architecture, and began looking for partners who could work with us on designing a new site. But the work that you see represented in the newly launched site began many months before.

In the winter of 2013, shortly after I joined CfA, Abhi Nemani asked me to conduct research on our “architecture of participation” &#8212; how do all the people and governments who do civic tech work with us initially connect, what is their path through our various programs, and is the experience we’re delivering in line with their needs? Very big questions, and very important ones for a maturing organization. I needed to do substantial research and serious analysis, and understand some fairly deep matters of motivation.

<!--more-->In the end I conducted close to 40 qualitative interviews myself, and sat in on more conducted by others. I listened to current and alumni fellows and Fellowship applicants; Brigade captains, members, and prospective members; public servants who had been in our Fellowship and Peer Network, and people who just happened to visit our website. Before I began (as I always do) I wrote down my top assumptions about what I would find. I expected that our participants would see Code for America as a movement, or a component of one, and be motivated to move closer to the heart of the movement through their participation. Creating easy paths between our programs would be important in enabling them to do that.

While fluidity between programs turns out to be important, I was absolutely wrong about motivation, and this is one of my favorite research findings ever: all sorts of participants engage with Code for America because they want to use their skills for the public good &#8212; it’s almost a superhero motivation, you could state it for emphasis as “use your powers for good.” Or simply as “they want to code for America” if you allow a little slippiness in the definition of “code”.

I had known through years of research studies elsewhere that people who enjoy their work identify deeply with that work; the promise of being able to apply those skills they enjoy and identify with to make a contribution to their community is incredibly compelling. Code for America is necessary because, in different ways, many people are blocked from using their best skills for the public good. Public servants may have difficulty bringing modern technology skills into governments on their own; technologists working in commercial companies may have little outlet to create social change. Entrepreneurs may face hard challenges breaking in to government markets. We can and do help with all of these blocks through providing opportunities, support, and recognition.

As the findings from these interviews developed, I created maps of experiences that served these needs for support, recognition, and opportunities with impact. Looking at long term involvement in civic technology, it became clear that people and institutions could pass through several of our programs, and through intense and less intense engagements with us, on the way to our and their ultimate goal: long-term use of everyone’s best abilities to make government (aka “what we do together”) better. The disappointment that we had heard about related to our old website began to make more sense, and to seem more urgent. It wasn’t simply a matter of an outdated design &#8212; people were hearing about us, visiting our site hoping to start putting their skills to civic use, and being confronted with an array of opaquely named programs and an invitation to sign up for our newsletter. Quite a few of people were applying for our Fellowship (which has less than a 5 percent acceptance rate) as a first interaction with us, and deciding civic tech wasn’t for them if they weren’t offered a spot. While we highlighted the work and bios of our Fellows on the site, their public servant partners and other local officials in our Peer Network, the volunteers in our Brigade, and the entrepreneurs in our Accelerator were faceless.

As our staff set to work integrating our programs more closely, it was clear that we needed a new organizational structure for the site: one that showed the variety of what we do, and didn’t require participants to understand our suite of programs in order to get started. In fact (and we’re still only partway there) the ideal experience is for a website visitor to find an opportunity to contribute on their first visit, without an application process or any other barrier. We can trust that a rewarding first experience will lead them to deeper involvement.

Based on all of this, we decided to anchor the site around landing pages for three critical constituencies: citizens, governments, and donors. Each group would be offered a central page showing the wealth of ways to participate across programs, and inviting them to dive in. I made a quick sketch back in May to show this idea to the CfA team:

While it doesn’t look exactly like the [Citizens page](http://www.codeforamerica.org/geeks "Citizens page"), which has undergone a lot of refinement, the basic concepts are all there. Our first attempts at organizing the site content this way weren’t perfect:

[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-30064" alt="Photo Feb 07, 11 28 01 AM" src="http://www.codeforamerica.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Photo-Feb-07-11-28-01-AM.jpg" />](http://www.codeforamerica.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Photo-Feb-07-11-28-01-AM.jpg)

and while by this point it was clear that we wanted a newly designed site for a couple of reasons &#8212; we wanted a design that reflected our core values of openness, currency, and optimism, and we wanted it to be built in a way that allowed much more flexibility than our old WordPress platform. We soon realized that the old site represented an opportunity for experimentation. We sketch pages for our constituencies, and filled in the other, foundational pieces of the site (an About section, a section to showcase the apps that result from all our programs, our blog).

As Dana Oshiro documents in her <a title="Testing the Ugly Duckling" href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/blog/2014/02/21/ugly_duckling/" target="_blank">post on our testing strategy</a>, we began by implementing a Citizens and Cities landing pages on the old site over the summer. By August, we were seeing positive results in site analytics and were ready to commit from an information architecture perspective. We still needed a more beautiful and flexible design system, but that would come through our collaboration with Dojo4 and ClearLeft. We were confident that our new site would actually serve our participants&#8217; needs, whatever it looked like in the end.
