Frequently asked questions:

&#8220;What&#8217;s your name?&#8221;*
  
&#8220;Marie&#8217;s not your middle name?&#8221;**
  
&#8220;Pan&#8230; uh, how do you pronounce your last name?&#8221;\***
  
&#8220;Where are you from?&#8221;\****

In addition to having a name that&#8217;s confusing to many people, my identity is wrapped up in where I live, where I&#8217;ve lived, and where I feel at home. Cities play an enormous role in shaping who we are and how we interact with the world. When I lived in the suburbs of Los Angeles, I had no reason to become good at parallel parking. After a few years of living in Chicago, I became an expert. When I moved to San Francisco, parallel parking on steep hills with a stick shift was a breeze.

Intersperse the word &#8220;like&#8221; into your sentences while talking to someone in Chicago and prepare to be teased. Order a pop when you’re in San Francisco and you’ll probably get some funny looks. Amble across the street outside of a crosswalk in Chicago, and you are a second away from being roadkill. Jaywalk in Los Angeles and either you get a $250 ticket or drivers might stop, get out of their cars and hold your hand so you can get across safely. Walk barefoot down the middle of a dusty road talking to your three off-leash dogs like they&#8217;re grade school children in the old coal mining town of Madrid, New Mexico; and, well, you’re perfectly ordinary.

I code for America because I am fascinated by our cities&#8217; idiosyncrasies and how understanding them can move us to make improvements that matter.

I code for America because our country can benefit from more empathy and authentic conversations &mdash; the kind where you walk away feeling like you truly know the other person and that he/she truly knows you.

I code for America because our cities need help. My hands and my mind have spent a lot of time helping big corporations make more money. Now it&#8217;s time for my whole self to show up, join together with talented and motivated people, tackle challenging problems, and participate in something much more meaningful.

* Anna Marie Panlilio
  
** No, Ferrer is my middle name.
  
\*** Pan like a frying pan. Lily like a flower. And O like O.
  
\**** San Francisco by way of Los Angeles and Chicago; with a dash of Albuquerque, New Mexico and Florence, Italy.
