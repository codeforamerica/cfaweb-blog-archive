<p dir="ltr">
  Joy Bonaguro works at the nexus of public policy, analysis, and technology – from open government, health IT, and transportation to cyber security and privacy. She was recently appointed the Chief Data Officer for the City of San Francisco.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  We spoke with Joy about collaborating with the local Brigade on a new housing visualization project during <a href="http://hackforchange.org/">National Day of Civic Hacking.</a>
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  <strong>Project background:</strong>
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  Housing is a <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/04/14/sf-housing/">pressing issue</a> in San Francisco. As one of her first projects Joy wanted to showcase how data aggregation, visualization, and clarification could help demystify an issue that touches everyone. The goal of the project is to present housing policy and programs, with accompanying data, to serve as a shared information resource on housing.
</p>

  <strong>Driving force behind attending National Day of Civic Hacking and preparing for the day:</strong>
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  After shopping the idea around internally, Joy began iterating with a basic sketch and a rudimentary wireframe. Recent to the role, Joy had wanted to find an opportunity to work with the local Brigade. Working with the Brigade at National Day of Civic Hacking (NDoCH) seemed like the right opportunity. After introducing the idea to the local Brigade, Joy worked with Jason Lally and Jay Nath from the Innovation office to break the project down into defined tasks, keeping in mind the diverse skill set of the Brigade. This included design, content research and creation, data collection, and back end development. An important part of working with the volunteers was to clearly articulate the value and principals of the project – ‘Striving for neutrality’ and making a site to inform people about housing.

  <strong>During the event:</strong>
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  The nature of NDoCH took careful but flexible project management:
</p>

<li dir="ltr">
  <p dir="ltr">
    Project pitch: Respecting the Brigades format, Joy used their template to present the idea and pitched with the 10 other projects at NDoCH.
  </p>
</li>

<li dir="ltr">
  <p dir="ltr">
    Team Setup: After the pitch, a group of volunteers approached Joy to learn more about the project. “We started by discussing the goals of the project, the neutral tone we wanted to keep, and the planned tasks for the day. We then took inventory of the various talents in the room and adjusted our tasks to allow for everyone to contribute.” Based on this discussion, volunteers either committed or moved on to other groups.
  </p>

  <p dir="ltr">
    Production: Breaking the work into quick wins and digestible tasks, the volunteer group of about 6 got to work:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li dir="ltr">
      <p dir="ltr">
        Deciding the ‘what’ it was they were trying to build and benchmarks for the two days
      </p>
    </li>
    
    <li dir="ltr">
      <p dir="ltr">
        Identifying areas of policy and data that could be visualized
      </p>
    </li>
    
    <li dir="ltr">
      <p dir="ltr">
        Designing the overall site and information architecture, using card sorting and wireframes
      </p>
    </li>
    
    <li dir="ltr">
      <p dir="ltr">
        Developing the back end architecture of the site. This involved volunteer from an additional stakeholder – <a href="http://www.bayesimpact.org/">Bayes Impact.</a>
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
</li>

<li dir="ltr">
  <p dir="ltr">
    Wrapping up: Reviewed accomplishments at the end of day one and set goals for day two.
  </p>
</li>

<p dir="ltr">
  Joy noted, “In case no one was interested in my pitch, I had a contingency plan. Worst case scenario, I would iterate on the <a href="http://www.weebly.com/">weebly template</a> and use embedded google maps and charts.” Fortunately, Joy had a great group of volunteers join her.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  In addition to her own project, Joy’s role as Chief Data Officer inevitably pulled her into other projects and she advised other groups throughout the event. Being organized and having a workplan helped ensure her project stayed on track when she was with other projects.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  Seeing the struggles and hearing the questions from other projects was also helpful for Joy. “It was eye opening to see how much work we need to do to make our data more accessible. It was great to feel the pain of our users.”
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  <strong>Sustaining the collaboration from NDoCH:</strong>
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  “Being able to work with designers and technologists to visualize the API and turn our idea into something tangible was a great leap forward,” according to Joy. However, it’s usually not sufficient to rely on hackathons or hack nights as the sole resource for a project. Joy has committed volunteers that are helping with back end development while she is working on data collection and content. They meet at weekly hack nights, which allows other Brigade volunteers to join or provide input.

  <strong>Approaching the &#8216;alien culture&#8217; of Civic Tech:</strong>
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  Approaching the young, and often intimidating, culture of civic tech can be a barrier for city staff. Brigade captains should go beyond just inviting city staff to a hack night. Try forming a relationship before an event – even a phone call or coffee can help set expectations and start relationships. Jesse, the SF Brigade leader, previously invited Joy to make a presentation on the values and and goals for SF’s open data and to plant the seed for the housing project. This set the stage for Joy’s involvement during NDoCH and introduced her to the space and people prior to the two day event, making it easier to develop trust and relationships.
