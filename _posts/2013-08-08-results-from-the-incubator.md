The inaugural class year of the [Code for America Incubator](http://www.codeforamerica.org/incubator-2/) has officially come to a close. Over the course of seven months, the companies received mentorship and training in design, engineering, sales, finance, and other topics related to business and technology. Founders received desks here at CfA, where they could continue working full-time from the office on their startup.
