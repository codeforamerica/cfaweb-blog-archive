[<img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-22173" title="8686908663_fa76d45446" src="http://codeforamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/8686908663_fa76d454461-300x199.jpg" alt="" />](http://www.flickr.com/photos/juggernautco/8686908663/)For [National Day of Civic Hacking](http://hackforchange.org), Chicago will play host to three separate events. The first is the [ChicagoMigraHack](http://www.chicagomigrahack.com/), a hackathon focused on the issue of immigration. The second event will be a [youth focused hackathon at the Adler Planetarium.](http://civichack.adlerplanetarium.org/) And finally, there will be an assortment of different civic hacking activities at [Hack for Chicago](http://www.meetup.com/OpenGovChicago/events/119353342/) hosted at the entrepreneurial coworking space [1871](http://1871.com). They’ll also be a [Civic Hacking 101 class](https://plus.google.com/u/0/events/cqantb3id5ap5t39sahdhe6u920) streamed nationally to help orient people who are new to civic hacking.

To say that Chicago does a lot of civic hacking events would be an understatement. For the last year, civic minded web developers, data scientists, designers, and community organizers have gathered at [1871](http://1871.com) each Tuesday for the [Chicago OpenGov Hack Night](http://opengovhacknight.eventbrite.com/). Recently, the Chicago Police Department [hosted a hackathon at Google Chicago](http://www.smartchicagocollaborative.org/using-the-new-clearpath-api-to-help-communities-interact-with-the-chicago-police-department/) in order to find creative ways to use the new [ClearPath API](http://api1.chicagopolice.org/clearpath/documentation). Part of the reason for all this activity is that the City of Chicago has released a [ton of open data](http://data.cityofchicago.org) that helps fuel civic app development: 931 datasets and counting.

  So, for <a href="http://hackforchange.org">National Day of Civic Hacking</a> it only made sense to have multiple events. These events were helped to be put together by a variety of partners including the <a href="http://smartchicagocollaborative.org">Smart Chicago Collaborative</a>, <a href="http://ijj.org">Institute of Justice & Journalism</a>, <a href="http://www.adlerplanetarium.org/">Adler Planetarium</a>, <a href="http://buildcibola.org">Cibola</a>, <a href="http://www.macfound.org/">The MacArthur Foundation</a>, the <a href="http://www.architecture.org/page.aspx?pid=183">Chicago Architecture Foundation</a>, <a href="http://www.mikvachallenge.org/">Mikva Challenge</a>, <a href="http://umbmentoring.org/">Center for Evidence-Based Mentoring</a>, <a href="http://hivechicago.org">Hive Chicago</a>, <a href="http://www.freespiritmedia.org/">Free Spirit Media</a>, <a href="http://knightlab.northwestern.edu/">Knight Lab</a>, <a href="http://opencityapps.org">Open City Apps</a>, and the <a href="http://digital.cityofchicago.org">City of Chicago</a>.

  While hackathons are great for organizing around civic issues and getting together to solve problems using technology, they aren&#8217;t the best method for actually building civic apps. That’s why we’re encouraging participants to continue the ideas that start at National Day of Civic Hacking by attending the weekly <a href="http://opengovhacknight.eventbrite.com/">OpenGov Hack Nights</a>. (You can see a list of hack nights in your area by visiting the <a href="http://brigade.codeforamerica.org/">Code for America Brigade</a> website.)
