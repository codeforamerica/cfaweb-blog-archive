So it&#8217;s Tuesday morning, you&#8217;re in your techie office complete with exposed brick, 27&#8243; monitors, ping pong tables, and then you realize that oddly everyone in the office has red on. And there&#8217;s chocolate&#8230; everywhere. Yup, that&#8217;s right, it&#8217;s Valentine&#8217;s Day, and here&#8217;s to guessing you might have forgotten to get something for that special, witty, glasses-wearing significant other of yours. 

Not to worry. Our corps of civic minded geeks have [got your back](http://cfavalentines.herokuapp.com/):

Building off of our [blog post](http://codeforamerica.org/2011/02/14/my-geeky-valentine/) last year, CfA Honolulu &#8212; Mick Thompson, Diana Tran, and Sheba Najmi &#8212; hacked together this little app to make it easier to show some geeky love. 

Just go to [c4a.me/cfavalentines](http://c4a.me/cfavalentines), click on your favorite card (mine is &#8220;You had me at Heroku&#8221; obviously), and you can email it off to your Valentine with a special note.

I&#8217;ll send some additional love to the fellows &#8212; a collaboration of 2011 and 2012! &#8212; who designed the lovely cards, including Karla, Anna, Ryan, Diana, and Mick, and if you&#8217;ve got a good idea for another, let us know at [@codeforamerica](http://twitter.com/codeforamerica).

Happy Valentine&#8217;s Day,
  
_Your Nerdy Cupids at Code for America_

(As an extra geeky note: the fellows were able to [reuse](https://github.com/codeforamerica/geeky_valentines) the [code](https://github.com/codeforamerica/postcard) they had written for the [HNL Hackathon](http://opensource.com/government/12/1/honolulu-looks-build-new-local-tools-and-applications): opensource &#8220;civic&#8221; software FTW.)
