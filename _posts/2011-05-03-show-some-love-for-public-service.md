_&#8220;Let the public service be a proud and lively career. And let every man and woman who works in any area of our national government, in any branch, at any level, be able to say with pride and with honor in future years: I served the United States Government in that hour of our nation&#8217;s need.&#8221;_ &#8211; President John F Kennedy, State of the Union, 1961

This quote from of President Kennedy tends to be overshadowed by the famed line from his inaugural, &#8220;ask not what your country can do for you,&#8221; and indeed, we&#8217;re [guilty of this](http://codeforamerica.org/binary-art/) ourselves. That&#8217;s because Kennedy&#8217;s call-to-action captures our own mission to define internet citizens as active ones, and we do believe people have the ability and the responsibility to give back &#8212; in [one](http://codeforamerica.org/2011/04/15/code-for-communities-rise-to-the-challenge/) [way](http://codeforamerica.org/2011/04/27/apa-conference/) or [another](http://codeforamerica.org/2011/02/02/clay-johnson-on-our-conspiracy-you-are-the-new-scribes/). But there are those that go above and beyond. 

They are called public servants, but in reality they&#8217;re our heroes. They go to work everyday, not for the fame or for the money, but out of a passion for service. They make sure our schools are open, our buses and trains running, and our streets safe. But too often their contributions go unnoticed or unappreciated. We think [it&#8217;s time we changed that](http://welovepublicservice.org).

This week is Public Service Recognition Week, and together with our friends over at [GovLoop](http://govloop.com), we are asking everybody to let the public service men and women in your life know how much you appreciate their work, and give them a (digital) high five for everything they do. Check it out and show some love: <http://welovepublicservice.org>. They deserve it.
