Tuesday our founder Jennifer Pahlka kicked off Accelerator Demo Day by sharing why there’s a demand for startups that build tools to help government work better. There’s been staggering advances in consumer technology, but government has too often been left behind the technology innovation curve. Ron Bouganim, Accelerator director, explained the market demand for the work of civic startups, with Tim O’Reilly, founder of O’Reilly Media, providing closing comments on the growing civic startup ecosystem.



**The Companies**
  
The Accelerator Demo Day featured our seven civic startups: [Aunt Bertha](http://www.auntbertha.com/), [Captricity](http://www.captricity.com/), [LearnSprout](http://www.learnsprout.com/), [Measured Voice](http://www.measuredvoice.com/), [Mindmixer](http://www.mindmixer.com/), [Recovers](http://www.recovers.org/), and [Revelstone](http://www.revelstonelabs.com/) &#8211; pitching to an audience of investors, press, and members of the CfA community.

The Demo Day represents the culmination of more than a hundred hours of mentorship with industry leaders, key partnership building activities with government leaders, and four months of programming for our first cohort ever. We’re happy to have these fantastic companies join the Code for America family, and we’re excited to provide them a platform to further innovate government.
