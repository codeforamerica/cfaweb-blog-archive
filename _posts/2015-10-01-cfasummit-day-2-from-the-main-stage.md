#CfASummit continued today with main stage talks that dove into why the work of 21st century government matters. We learned the deep and lasting impact of using data to help make our communities healthier, safer, more just, and equitable.

[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-34367" src="http://www.codeforamerica.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/summit.jpg" alt="Drew Bird Photo | Visual Storyteller" />](http://www.codeforamerica.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/summit.jpg)

### The Takeaways:

This work matters to our communities. We aren’t just opening and using data for the sake of data—it’s to serve people, to deliver better services, and to empower people.

### The Talks:

Throughout the morning, speakers continuously had to pause for applause. Today’s recap is of the moments that resonated with the audience, that rippled across social media, and that made people look to their left and right and nod in agreement.

William Lightbourne, the Director of California Department of Social Services, opened the morning in conversation with Jake Solomon on what Social Services in California is currently doing and where it&#8217;s going.

He noted that government needs to move from a culture of eligibility to a culture of coverage.

He also said, “Do whatever you need by any means possible to help people.”

And, &#8220;Government needs to be flexible and interactive&#8230;We can’t outsource the work.&#8221;

Peter Levin, Founder and CEO of Amida Technology Solutions, spoke about creating safe secure access to health records through Blue Button. Blue button is the “open sesame button that will open the door to a whole new level of care,” he quoted.

Stacy Lindau, Associate Professor at the University of Chicago and Founder of NowPow, LLC spoke about prescribing community services to residents in Chicago.

She spoke passionately about disparities in health care— “there’s a mortality rate that is shameful in some of the richest cities in the world,” Stacy said.

&#8220;We need to see the unvisible. The unvisible is what we choose not to see because we choose not to look down there. We have biases and prejudices. To engineer solutions to injustices we need to see the unvisible.&#8221;

Danny Avula, Deputy Director of Richmond City Health Department, spoke about how poverty has pervasive impacts on the health and well-being of people. The parts of the city that have the highest rates of disease have the highest rate of poverty. To help solve this problem, the 2015 CfA Richmond Fellows built a tool to help facilitate community health screening. &#8220;While CfA built an elegant and useful tool,&#8221; Danny said, &#8220;that’s not it. They leveraged technology to start the process of systems change.&#8221;

### The Government Talent Pipeline

Hillary Hartley, Deputy Executive Director of 18F, started with a warm shout out to government employees. As she said, “Everybody on stage, everyone in my organization, we couldn’t be doing this work without you.” People want to do this work, she noted. &#8220;The pipeline is there. The people are there.&#8221;

As Maksim said, “A city culture where the mayor hired a guy who asked him for coffee and whose laptop flipped him off is definitely a culture that appeals to technologists.”

### Deepening Impact in Safety and Justice

Jenny Montoya-Tansey, the Director of Safety and Justice at CfA, spoke about how we’re in the midst of a fundamental shift in safety and justice. As she said, &#8220;Many of our public servants are working to create a justice system that works for the people by the people in the 21st century, and Code for America is here to lend a hand.&#8221;

Though as Jenny noted, tech isn’t the solution to change the justice system. We need leadership collaboration, policy change, and collaboration from others.

Tiffany Andrews of the 2015 CfA Indiana Fellowship team discussed fighting institutional barriers in order to address rooted problems. “How can we use the power of data as a tool of transparency and accountability?” Tiffany asked.

And as Tiffany reminded us, open criminal justice data is not the end goal, it’s just the first step on the path to reform.
