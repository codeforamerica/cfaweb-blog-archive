It&#8217;s difficult to define participation and it&#8217;s even more difficult to measure it. In Philadelphia, for example, the <a href="http://philly.changeby.us/" target="_blank">Change By Us</a> platform that launched last month is attracting a number of residents who want to work together to make Philadelphia a better city. But how does the local government measure their participation, is it simply number of users? That can&#8217;t be the complete picture because their impact isn&#8217;t captured in that measurement. These are just some of the challenges the City of Philadelphia and Code for America have faced while trying to measure public participation.

Therefore, it&#8217;s no surprise the Federal government is asking for help to determine the best practices and metrics for public participation. On <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2011/12/06/seeking-your-input-us-open-government-national-action-plan" target="_blank">December 6</a> they began seeking <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/webform/seeking-your-input-open-government-national-action-plan" target="_blank">input</a> on the best practices and metrics for public participation as part of their larger <a href="http://www.opengovpartnership.org/sites/www.opengovpartnership.org/files/country_action_plans/US_National_Action_Plan_Final_2.pdf" target="_blank">US National Open Government Action Plan</a>. We have been similarly challenged at Code for America in our public participation projects. We&#8217;ve found that collaboration, participation, and engagement can mean very different things to different groups of people and governments. In our projects we&#8217;ve tried to think of participation in its broadest sense, and build online tools that make participation easy, social, and widespread.

In our search to answer these tough questions <a href="http://www.civiccommons.org" target="_blank">Civic Commons</a> has pulled together a number of online resources that can help frame best practices for civic engagement. The <a href="http://wiki.civiccommons.org/" target="_blank">wiki</a> has helpful information and examples of participation, transparency, open data, and open source in action.

Another helpful resource designed for local officials is <a href="http://www.nlc.org/find-city-solutions/research-innovation/governance-civic-engagement/planning-for-stronger-local-democracy" target="_blank">Planning for Stronger Local Democracy: A Field Guide for Local Officials</a>. The field guide is a toolkit designed to assist officials in strengthening local democracy by cultivating transparency and inclusivity with citizens.

I encourage you to participate and <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/webform/seeking-your-input-open-government-national-action-plan" target="_blank">contribute your thoughts</a> to the White House to help shape the way our government thinks about and measures participation. It&#8217;s not an easy task and they shouldn&#8217;t be doing it alone. Share your input by January 3, 2012.
