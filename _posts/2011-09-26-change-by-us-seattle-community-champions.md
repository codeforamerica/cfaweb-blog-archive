Some people wake up in the morning wondering what they can do to make the world better and then there are the rare few who work to help others follow in their footsteps.

In Seattle, we have the privilege of working closely with four of them on [Change by Us.](http://seattle.changeby.us) Their faces are on the homepage, and they have agreed to lead the way, jumping in and offering their expertise to emerging or existing project leaders on the application. Here&#8217;s what they have to say about community organizing and leadership and why it matters to them:

I’ve only been in Seattle for three years but in so many ways I feel more invested in this city than my hometown, where I spent the first 22 years of my life. My attachment stems from all the meaningful community projects and relationships I’ve built. Being a part of real change in the city, collaborating with people who care about similar issues – that’s what excites me about finding new ways to empower the next generation of Seattle’s leaders.

[<img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-8684 alignleft" title="roniayalla" src="http://codeforamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/roniayalla-150x150.jpg" alt="" />](http://codeforamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/roniayalla.jpg)Seattle youth seek volunteer opportunities for many reasons – there’s that pesky service hours requirement at school of course, but that doesn’t tell the whole story based on my experiences working with teenagers across the Puget Sound region.

Seattle is rife with compassionate, engaged, and curious youth who want to get involved and improve their communities. The problem is most don’t know how to discover meaningful opportunities. And even when they do, they still face the challenge of retaining and nurturing that initial inspiration as they enter the hierarchical and often-intimidating settings of many traditional institutions. Questions go unanswered, meaningful relationships between adults and youth aren’t formed, and ultimately, opportunities to improve our great city in profound ways are left on the table.

I’m excited about the [seattle.changeby.us](http://seattle.changeby.us/) project because it eliminates many of the challenges of putting an idea to action. Put out a request for volunteers, promote your work, attract new supporters, manage your project more efficiently, run ideas by like-minded individuals – the site was designed with these goals in mind and to benefit everyone who chooses to get involved. Youth will be more engaged and confident citizens, and feel a sense of ownership and buy-in to the causes and campaigns they’re a part of;  community and business leaders meanwhile will feel inspired and inclined to collaborate with Seattle’s next generation of leaders in meaningful ways knowing that there is a streamlined and effective outlet at their disposal.

> &#8220;With all the good that&#8217;s happening in community a leader has the awesome privilege to share it with the world.&#8221;<span style="color: #000000;"><strong><br /> </strong></span>

Last week our neighborhood, Rainier Beach, had an Art Walk, where I saw demonstrations of collaboration among the merchants, artists and neighborhood. The week before that I sat with other local leaders and the public schools&#8217; superintendent to tell her what our schools needed. As a local leader that&#8217;s what you get to be a part of.

[<img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-8689 alignleft" title="gregory-davis" src="http://codeforamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/gregory-davis-150x150.jpg" alt="" />](http://codeforamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/gregory-davis.jpg)A thought I have about the importance of being involved in community and becoming a local leader is that with all the good that&#8217;s happening in community a leader has the awesome privilege to share it with the world.

Being a local leader in community positions you to have access to all walks of life, including young people who can help you tell what&#8217;s good in their own way. Check out [www.seseattlefreedomnet.org](http://www.seseattlefreedomnet.org/) to see how young people do it.

As people our natural tendency is to seek the good isn&#8217;t it? We are thrilled about telling the good things that happen to us. In my experience a community and all its various elements represents a grand opportunity for people to find good.  This week local leaders are getting together to ensure the neighborhood&#8217;s interests are represented in the city&#8217;s plans for the neighborhood &#8230; Who wouldn&#8217;t want to be a part of that?

> &#8220;It will always be the spirit of community that gets the work started and gets the work done.&#8221;

Community leaders have historically used forums or meetings as the starting point for that project or discussion.  These have been &#8220;in person&#8221; events and are useful and important but oft-times are difficult to set up or difficult to maintain interest in.

[<img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-8767" title="chas-redmond" src="http://codeforamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/chas-redmond-150x150.jpg" alt="" />](http://codeforamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/chas-redmond.jpg)In the last few years, additional electronic tools have emerged which offer a link between the online lists and web resources and the in-person discussions and back-and-forth dialog of meetings.  These tools are empowering because they allow individuals who are at the &#8220;just arrived&#8221; end of a project to not only catch up on previous recorded discourse but be able to communicate directly with the whole group and provide new input easily.

New technology has a role to play, but it’s important to remember that it will always be the spirit of community that gets the work started and gets the work done.

In that regard, here are some thoughts:

  1. Choose goals that are sufficiently broad that a large number of individuals will agree they are worthy pursuits;
  2. Hold meetings and identify challenges, risks, strengths and participants and be solicitous and invite leadership opportunities;
  3. Use appropriate technology and be aware that some participants may not have or may be challenged by particular technologies so discuss and agree on approaches to the use of tools;
  4. Make inquiry and research a major component of the startup process for a new project and engage the group in performing that research, in this way there are multiple new sources of information
  5. Where practical, document your thoughts, processes, progress and concerns and make that information widely accessible;

The end result of these efforts is always a better neighborhood or community.  How the participants get to the end of the project can be assisted by tools and technology but we always need to remember that it&#8217;s the people who are collaborating which bring a project to fruition, the technology only helps if we use it appropriately and everyone understands how and agrees to its use.

[<img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-8693" title="sol-villareal-flip" src="http://codeforamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/sol-villareal-flip-150x150.jpg" alt="" />](http://codeforamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/sol-villareal-flip.jpg)Participation is the bedrock of a democracy, and we Seattleites participate more than just about any other city in the country, as evidenced by our high rates of voter turnout, community activism, and volunteerism. We understand that by coming together we can accomplish more than we can on our own, and a lot of the things that make Seattle such a great place to live stem from that basic understanding, from the great neighborhoods we’re proud to call our homes to our collective willingness to pay for the things we value, from parks to public education to affordable housing.

Those of us who work in local government see ourselves as your partners in the effort to make Seattle a better place to live, and part of that partnership has always involved bringing together diverse groups of residents to help solve our common problems, whether through public meetings and advisory committees or Neighborhood Matching Fund grants.

Now, through a partnership with Code for America, we’re getting ready to roll out a new tool called Change By Us that’s specifically designed to make it easier for community members to work together on local projects. The public beta is available now; you can give it a try at [http://seattle.changeby.us](http://seattle.changeby.us/). If you have any questions, comments, or concerns, or if you just want to talk to someone in the Mayor’s Office, please send me an email at <sol.villarreal@seattle.gov> or give me a call at [206-427-3062](tel:206-427-3062). I’ll look forward to hearing from you.
