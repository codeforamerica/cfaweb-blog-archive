Fortunately, we are seeing such leaders emerge: Just this year, a Senior Designer at Google took a year off to work on criminal justice reform in Louisville; a social worker built a civic startup to improve child welfare; and an Oakland city councilwoman lead the passage of over a half-dozen legal reforms committing her city to innovation.

These are the people who make up Code for America, and we could not be more humbled by their passion, skill, and accomplishments. This year, they have shown us that what began four years ago as an experiment in helping governments work better has now turned into a national and international movement of technologists working on issues that matter.

<p style="text-align: left;">
  <strong>Now we need your help to keep building that movement.</strong> Will you help us reach even more cities and countries next year by <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/donate">making a contribution to the annual Code for America giving campaign?</a>

  * **Fellows, startups, and Brigades took on even tougher civic challenges.** A key theme for this year was going deeper &#8212; deeper into areas like healthcare, housing, and crime &#8212; which has led to both new opportunities and challenges. Teams grappled with issues like privacy and accessibility &#8212; and built tools that are improving the delivery of critical public services.
  * **Thousands of citizens and dozens of cities have built a powerful network.** We’ve more than doubled the number of volunteer Brigade chapters in the US, with 3,000+ members, and our newest program, the Peer Network, is now active in 50+ cities. Beyond our shores, we have launched our first international program, Code for All. Together, this network is a platform for scaling innovation virally, with apps, data standards, and policies being replicated across the country.
  * **Structural changes are paving the way for continued innovation.** In cities across the country, citizens and government officials are catalyzing systemic changes by building new government skill sets, launching new policies and reforming old ones, opening datasets, engaging the community, setting the stage for new positions and structures that foster experimentation, and demonstrating new ways of leveraging technology that can save money.

With your help, we can build upon this work to make 2014 a year of broader scale and even deeper impact. But we can’t do it without you. Your support is critical to our continued growth and success. [Whether it’s $20 or $2,000 &#8211; whatever you can give – every contribution is meaningful.](http://www.codeforamerica.org/donate)
