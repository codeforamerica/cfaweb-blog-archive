  On June 19th, Code for America held its inaugural mid-year showcase to highlight work done so far by the 2014 Fellows and staff. The event was coined <a href="http://beta.codeforamerica.org/">BETA</a>, which means “advice on how to successfully complete a particular route or path” in the rock climbing world. The term appropriately illustrates our journey to the <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/summit/">Summit</a>, now just a few short months away.

At BETA, Fellows and staff shared stories about what&#8217;s been done, as well as what’s on the horizon.

  * [Team Chattanooga](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEV7TxsHVqM) showed us how they are building capacity in local governments by supporting an ecosystem of innovation
  * [Team Atlanta](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Kwh2K6naI) showed us how they are moving long lines at the courthouse to simple online services
  * [Team Rhode Island](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dymBKljgWnA) showed how improving application processes can help break the cycle of distrust between parents and schools
  * [Team Long Beach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yusm1fwBuz0) showed us how governments can use data to make important decisions that can apply human interventions to the root of the problem

Jennifer Pahlka, our founder and Executive Director who recently returned from a year in the federal government, shared a bit about her time in DC. She echoed what she said in her [recent blog post](http://www.codeforamerica.org/blog/2014/06/10/theres-no-place-like-home/) about those who work within government:

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  &#8220;I leave with an even greater commitment to change, but also with a deeper empathy for those trying to change the system from within.&#8221;
</p>

And, no good tech event would be complete without AV problems. Our talented Fellows Molly McLeod and Maya Benari saved the day with their mad [juggling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEOHhJSSIIQ) and [beatboxing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ5W1wXiNSU) skills.

We welcomed more than 200 people to our office in San Francisco and many more joined us via livestream. Now, we&#8217;re excited to share the work with those of you who couldn’t make it. As we highlighted during BETA, we continue to encourage you to send feedback and ideas to each of the teams. The feedback received will help inform our work going forward.
