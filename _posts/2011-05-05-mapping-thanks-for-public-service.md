Earlier this week, we launched WeLovePublicService.org, and it&#8217;s been great to see the hundreds of heartfelt responses submitted in just a few days. We wanted to help public servants and everyone see where all the love is coming from, so fellows Jeremy Canfield, Michael Evans, and Michael Bernstein put together a [dynamic map](http://welovepublicservice.org/map) using CloudMate showcasing the submissions from across the country. Check it out: <http://welovepublicservice.org/map>

(And if you&#8217;re not seeing any dots where you&#8217;re from, do something about it: post a quick thanks before the end Public Service Recognition Week: <http://welovepublicservice.org>)
