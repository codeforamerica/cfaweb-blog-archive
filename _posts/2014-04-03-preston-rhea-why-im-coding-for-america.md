People who want the most out of life seek to know many perspectives. We are hungry to experience new ways to see things, always trying to discover the unexpected to paint a better picture of life. I seek to know where our lives can go when we build tools that we must use together, to leverage each other instead of divide one another.

That is why I&#8217;m excited to join Code for America, as part of the communities team. I am thrilled at the challenge and opportunity to help folks from many cities maximize the impact of the skills in their communities for the benefit of all. I cannot wait to learn their perspectives and why they care about where they live. I have long known Code for America&#8217;s reputation as a locus of gravity-shifting change, transformative to our global civic ecosystems and to the people who work with the organization. I am humbled to share the responsibility that comes with transformative power.

Our collective power comes from our connections to each other. Billions of people benefit from web technology, yet relatively few of us act together to design, create, and extend the global information project we call the Internet. Too often, we have to call in the &#8220;experts.&#8221; But we need a way for everyone to put their talents towards this project. What we use to truly unite us, we must build with everything we have to offer &#8212; every specific skill, every wild story, all shapes and forms and roles names for ourselves and every perspective we have of the thing we&#8217;ve painted between us that we call the world. Especially the worldviews of people who are traditionally excluded from the privilege of being an &#8220;expert&#8221; in web technologies.

Building the internet and the web, still fundamentally peer-to-peer, can provide a path to renew the only thing that shares our social contract &#8212; our local governments. Let&#8217;s direct the rolling tide of technology towards enriching and evolving that contract. We cannot let the makers of those tools erode our collective institutions away into privatized, atomized fiefdoms. I am concerned that if we do not build power together, we will tumble into a new feudalism.

The people that form America build a culture I enjoy celebrating. It is worth protecting, but it&#8217;s also worth pushing further. With collective power leveraged by collective technology, what are the new physical, mental, cultural, and spiritual frontiers we can explore? Here at Code for America, I am hungry to explore the potential of the civic technology movement, and the potential of a country through this movement. This is the place to be to turn the growing force of technology-leveraged skills to bend the moral arc of history towards justice.
