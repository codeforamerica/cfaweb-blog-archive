The Code for America Communities team is excited to debut the new website for the Brigade Program! Check it out [here](http://codeforamerica.org/brigade/).

The new site reflects the input of Brigade Captains and members around the globe. Andrew Hyder, our developer evangelist, built the new site with a mind towards getting people to quickly apply their skills towards civic improvement.

The new site showcases a local Brigade&#8217;s activity and events by just clicking on the map. This way, people can easily find their closest Brigade community,  quickly understand the activity their chapter is undertaking, and see when the next meetup is so they can attend.

For example, here is what the Code for DC Brigade has going on right now:

The activity reports on the Brigade website are powered by the new Code for America API. The API helps civic hackers and public innovators easily report and gather information about how they invest their time and skills to make their cities better places.

We’re excited to deepen our commitment to the Brigade program as a way to scale the impact that civic innovation is having on governments, startups, and democracy. We hope you will join us as we venture forward.
