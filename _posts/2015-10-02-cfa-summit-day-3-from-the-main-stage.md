#CfASummit wrapped up today with talks that had the audience on their feet. Today addressed how governments across the US and abroad are changing their culture, using the tools, and embedding values of 21st century government. Some of these values are empathy, autonomy, and continuous learning. We heard from governments and community organizers who have embedded these values and are doing the work and changing people’s lives in the process.

### The Takeaways:

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Governments are incredibly diverse because they reflect the communities they serve</span>. 21st century government, tools, and the values we embed honor this diversity by delivering the best possible user-centered, human-centered services for the people, by the people.

“The problems we face are large but our community is getting larger and we’re getting stronger. That is what I take away from the Summit each year, and I want to thank all of you.”

While #CfASummit ended today—the work of 21st century government never ends. We are thrilled and inspired by all of you who joined us at the Summit. We’ll carry the lessons we learned, relationships we formed, and energy we gained with us throughout the year. We hope you’ll do the same. Looking forward to seeing you back in Oakland next year for the 2016 Code for America Summit, November 2-4!
