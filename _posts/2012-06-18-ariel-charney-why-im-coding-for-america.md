Why am I Coding for America?

First off, let me introduce myself. My name is Ariel Charney and I am a Montrealer, born and raised. I am a self-described environmental, human rights, and student activist. You may be wondering, what is a native Montrealer doing in San Francisco at Code for America? Well, good question. I came across CfA by word of mouth (aka my sister) as I was painstakingly studying away at the University of Toronto. While my sister, Shira Lazar, lives in a place I like to call LaLa Land doing things I wish I did, like reporting on tech and civic start-ups. (Just a little plug: Her show is called “What’s Trending with Shira Lazar,” it is awesome and you should follow her on youtube and twitter!)

Lets face it, government can often be inaccessible and inefficient and this is where CfA comes in. CfA bridges the gap between government and citizen. CfA fills a void in civic engagement. CfA democratizes public information. CfA puts tools for change in our hands. All of these are necessary aspects of strong civil society, which is a part of the Canadian and United States ethos. Unfortunately, I feel this spirit of engagement has definitely been fading. However, there is so much creativity coming from tech developers worldwide. People are dissatisfied with government, and the Internet is the way people are now enacting change. Think of Facebook, Twitter, the Arab Spring, Occupy movement, and all the amazing civic start-ups we’re seeing. Tech has brought a new wave of citizenship, providing boundless information, networks, and civic potential. CfA is part of that movement. I have not come across anything like CfA in Montreal or Toronto. I have so much to learn and I am excited to see CfA in action. Who knows maybe in a few years time there will be a Code for Canada! This is why I am Coding for America, practicing what I believe in, getting inspired, and hopefully helping people out along the way.

Until next time,

Your Canadian friend Coding for America, Ariel.
