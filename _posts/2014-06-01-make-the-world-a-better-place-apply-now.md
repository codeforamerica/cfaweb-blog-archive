  Are you a developer, designer, researcher or product manager? Do you want to use your skills for good? We are seeking a new cohort of Fellows for our 2015 Fellowship class, committed to discovering new ways that technology can fix some of the problems that our governments face.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  In the four years Code for America has been doing this work, <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/geeks/our-geeks/2014-fellows/">102 fellows</a> have been embedded in <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/cities/2014-cities/">32 local governments</a> across the U.S. to build applications that address issues that are important to the local community. Fellows have inspired creativity, collaboration, and new approaches to problem solving in City Hall.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  In past years, Fellowship teams have worked on projects to <a href="http://ohanapi.org/">increase access to social services</a>, <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/library/item/6d0a38368cbc924c">explore alternatives to incarceration</a>, and <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/blog/2012/06/05/announcing-textizen-citizen-feedback-for-the-digital-age/">create new avenues for public participation</a>.  Fellows work with their government partners to <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/library/item/63383ebd1e53e455">leverage data to make more informed decisions</a> and <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/library/item/8115a25a44776eda">design government services so that they work for the residents who use them</a>. Fellows have helped launch <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/brigade/">Brigades</a> in their cities, and have forged relationships between community groups and the government so that they can work on the issues facing their communities together.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  We’re looking for a diverse class of Fellows with a variety of backgrounds and a wide range of skills, expertise, and interests. In the past, we have had Fellows come from large companies like Google and Apple, and government agencies such as NASA, while some come from tech startups. All of our Fellows have a creative, collaborative, entrepreneurial spirit and are passionate about making our country better.
</p>

  If you want to get an in-depth view of how local government works, receive unparalleled networking, mentorship and support from some of the biggest names in tech, accomplish a lot and make the world a better place, you should apply to be a Code for America Fellow, today. Applications are due by July 15th, 2014. <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/apply">codeforamerica.org/apply</a>
