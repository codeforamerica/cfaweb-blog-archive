We&#8217;re thrilled to be based out of the SoMA area of San Francisco, a hotbed for tech startups (where keeping tabs on new companies is as easy as searching for a new wireless network). Almost everyday, it seems, there&#8217;s a new company with a new product and a new possibility for impact. And this is just in one part of the city.

This summer, we&#8217;re going to be working with our friends at [Gray Area Foundation for the Arts](http://gaffta.org) (GAFFTA) to take advantage of that energy and talent with a new initiative to develop innovative solutions to pressing urban issues for San Francisco. The program, called _[Summer of Smart](http://summerofsmart.org)_, will directly engage SF’s innovation, urbanism, and social change communities through a series of events throughout the summer, kicking off this Thursday, June 16th, with [SFOpen11](http://sf.govfresh.com/sfopen2011/), a debate on technology and open government between nine mayoral candidates presented with [GovFresh](http://govfresh.com) and [Change.org](http://change.org). This will be followed by the second annual [CityCampSF](http://citycampsf.org) unconference just two days later on June 18.

And that&#8217;s just the start. Summer of Smart consists of three components:

  * **A series of Urban Challenge Weekends** – 48-hour hack-a-thons where application prototypes are developed in key urban focus areas; accompanied by keynote speakers and cocktail discussion mixers
  * **A series of public events** – debates, forums, presentations, and (un)conferences – around the issues of open data, open government, technology, and innovation
  * **An online portal** of all the applications and media coverage associated with the Summer, hosted and curated by GAFFTA and The Bay Citizen.

So there&#8217;s a lot going on, and we&#8217;re excited to be a part of it. We&#8217;re hoping to contribute to the ideas, technology, and connections made at events, and try to spread them nationally to maximize their impact.

But first things first: [a cocktail party](http://cocktails-candidates-code.eventbrite.com/). While the debate this week has limited seating &#8212; there will be livestreaming though! &#8212; as soon as it ends, we&#8217;ll open up the space at the Automattic / WordPress offices for cocktails, mixing, and discussion of the debate and all the exciting issues involved. We hope you&#8217;ll join us: <http://cocktails-candidates-code.eventbrite.com/>
