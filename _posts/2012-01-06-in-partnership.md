Not long ago we announced the forthcoming launch of a <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/2012/01/05/opportunity-build-run-the-cfa-accelerator/" target="_blank">Seed Accelerator</a> to foster civic focused tech startups. What&#8217;s a civic startup? Think TurboTax. An online application that aids millions of Americans each April. Though not created by the government it makes doing taxes a whole lot easier.

At a press conference this morning, held here in the Code for America office, San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee announced first-of-its-kind partnership with Code for America to bring greater innovation to San Francisco.

Our partnership with Mayor Lee and the City of San Francisco will give our civic startups unparalleled access for insights into city hall, and into what city hall needs to function better &#8212; allowing the startups to create innovative solutions for real city challenges.

&#8220;San Francisco is home to some of the world&#8217;s greatest entrepreneurs, the ones who have &#8216;disrupted&#8217; numerous industries and made our City a hub for innovation,&#8221; said Mayor Lee. &#8220;The challenge now is to bring those same disruptive technologies to make government more accountable and engaged, and make San Francisco, the world&#8217;s first City 2.0.&#8221;

Here are some pictures from the press conference:
