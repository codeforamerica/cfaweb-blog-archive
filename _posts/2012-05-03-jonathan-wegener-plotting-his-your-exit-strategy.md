He was kind enough to indulge our curiosity. Here are his responses to our inquiries:**

**How did you get into tech and particularly &#8220;civic&#8221; tech, and why did you found Exit Strategy NYC?
  
** I&#8217;ve always been interested in technology and from an early age was programming, and building my own computers, and then designing and building websites. We founded Exit Strategy NYC because I got tired of not knowing where to stand on the subway when I got to my home station in Brooklyn. I started writing down the information in the notepad of my iPhone and then realized &#8220;this should be an app.&#8221; I found someone had done it for Tokyo, and as a book in Toronto, but never NYC. I love NYC; I&#8217;ve been living here eight years and I couldn&#8217;t imagine that I was the only one who would care about a product like this. So we built it.

**What were the challenges of creating and maintaining the app and how did you deal with them? How much success did you have (e.g. revenue, etc.)?
  
** The biggest challenge was getting the data. My sister and I bought unlimited metrocards and spent three months riding the subways with a clipboard visiting every station and writing down how each station&#8217;s doors lined up with the train cars. We also had to find and hire designers and developers to work on the project with us. We had a lot of success and made enough to repay our expenses and make it worth our time. We also got articles about the product in _New York Times_, _New York Post_, _Wired_ magazine, and a host of others.

**Could you talk about your current project, Timehop, and what you plan on building in the future?
  
** We&#8217;re building Timehop.com right now. It&#8217;s an incredibly addictive daily email that tells you what you did a year ago today, based on your Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Foursquare content. The real time web has given us all rich archives of our lives, but right now they&#8217;re siloed in different services and devices. We&#8217;re building Timehop into the ultimate digital history experience.

**Your blog says you were told you &#8220;think too much,&#8221; in job interview. You didn&#8217;t get the job, but it was the greatest compliment you&#8217;ve gotten. Could you provide some more context about the incident, and explain why it was the greatest compliment?
  
** I was interviewing with a startup in 2008. I was meeting their CEO, a very very smart Russian man with a background in data and number crunching and math. We talked for a long while about the job and about whether I fit. Finally he remarked &#8220;you think too much&#8221; and later rejected me. It was the greatest compliment because it was an incredibly underhanded compliment. He was basically telling me I was overqualified&#8230;I can&#8217;t think of a better way to get rejected from a job!

**And finally, do you have any words of advice for others who want to start a civic-minded tech initiative such as Exit Strategy NYC, or want to use tech to improve gov&#8217;t/community?
  
** Be creative and build cool stuff that the community loves!
