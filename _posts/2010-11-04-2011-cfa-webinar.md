_&#8220;Ok, so what are you actually building?&#8221;_

That&#8217;s a question we run into more often than we care to admit, and understandably so. The Code for America process may seem short &#8212; _just_ a year-long fellowship &#8212; but for that process to work, we have to spend a lot of time with our cities beforehand, understanding their challenges, determining their needs, and gathering a sense what we want our fellows to build. Our products will only be as strong as our partnerships and our preparation. After months of brainstorming and development, we are excited to share with you our vision for what these applications will be and how they can help cities become more efficient, participatory and open.<!--more-->
