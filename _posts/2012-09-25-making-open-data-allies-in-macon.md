Last week, I partnered with two neighborhood groups to hold a Conversation on Technology. At Mercer University&#8217;s brand-new [Center for Collaborative Journalism](http://ccj.mercer.edu/), 20-25 students and community members gathered for an early look at our projects. Before the event, I also met with the [College Hill Alliance](http://collegehillalliance.com) and [Habitat for Humanity](http://maconhabitat.org) so we could present applications for open data from around Macon, Ga.

For Habitat for Humanity, we looked over Bibb County&#8217;s buildings map, last updated in 2007. This offered Habitat an opportunity to map out where rebuilding had taken place, and add photos and descriptions of their future projects. Using [a mapping tool based on CartoDB](http://blog.cartodb.com/post/29822497608/a-code-for-americas-open-city-tool-powered-by-cartodb), I sat down with Harold Tessendorf and he walked me through each site impacted by their work. The end product could be shown in Google Maps or downloaded into Google Earth.

Nadia Osman, our contact at the College Hill Alliance, had a specific map in mind. The group [started as a student project](http://www.collegehillmacon.com/index.php/about/project-history) in 2006 and has worked tirelessly to revitalize the area around Mercer University. Nadia asked if we could find a change in housing code citations in their neighborhood over the past several years. With code enforcement data, [a Python script](https://gist.github.com/3747153), and a [MapBox.js timeline example](http://mapbox.com/mapbox.js/example/timeline/), a timeline-map materialized just in time for the event.

These maps sparked a great discussion with the event audience. Other non-profits asked if we could map posts from Twitter and Foursquare. Considering College Hill&#8217;s plans for entrepreneurship in Macon, students asked for maps of crime and available space. We don&#8217;t have all of that data, but our hope is that Code for America will have a lasting effect on the city&#8217;s ability to open data and develop new solutions.

For many of our attendees, it was their first visit to the Center for Collaborative Journalism. This is a place where you hear phrases like &#8220;data-driven journalism&#8221; and &#8220;teaching hospital for journalism.&#8221; I encourage y&#8217;all to follow [@MercerCCJ](https://twitter.com/mercerccj). You can expect innovative ideas and more open data projects in their future.

The event was [covered by the Macon Telegraph](http://www.macon.com/2012/09/23/2188526/beyond-software-programmers-hope.html) and shared live on Twitter ([shown in this Storify](http://storify.com/mapmeld/macon-maps-conversation-on-technology)).
