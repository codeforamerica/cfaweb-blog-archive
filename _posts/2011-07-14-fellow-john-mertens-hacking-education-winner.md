[<img src="http://codeforamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/mertonium1.jpeg" alt="" title="mertonium" class="alignright size-full wp-image-7413" />](http://codeforamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/mertonium.jpeg)Earlier this year, [DonorsChoose](http://supporterschoose.org), a huge and growing educational donation platform, announced an opportunity for developers and data crunchers to [Hack Education](http://www.donorschoose.org/hacking-education). On their site, more than 165,000 teachers at 43,000 public schools have posted over 300,000 classroom project requests, which have earned over a million donations; and they opened all that data up to developers to create apps that&#8217;ll engage the public and impact education. Today they announced the winners in each category &#8212; one for each core programming language &#8212; and **CfA Fellow John Mertens won** for his PHP app!

[His submission](http://mertonium.com/supporterschoose-projects-near-me-wordpress-plugin/) is a plugin for the popular CMS (e.g. you happen to be reading one now), WordPress, which determines the geographic location of each blog reader and displays nearby DonorsChoose classroom projects. For example, if you view [John&#8217;s site](http://mertonium.com/) from our offices, the plugin determines (correctly) that you&#8217;re in San Francisco and displays three projects in the SF area. It was great to see John&#8217;s app selected by three experts: Gina Trapani (ExpertLabs), Joi Ito (MIT Media Labs), Matt Mullenweg (WordPress).

Now the competition moves on to a final round, where the one lucky finalist will by crowned the &#8220;Big Winner&#8221; by none other than Stephen Colbert. We&#8217;re keeping our finger&#8217;s crossed for John! 

Check out all the [finalists](http://www.donorschoose.org/hacking-education-winners), and you can grab the wordpress plugin on [github](https://github.com/mertonium/DonorsChooseMe).
