_This is the third post in a short series in effort to recognize and celebrate the close of the 2013 Code for America Incubator. This new program was created to support Code for America Fellows as they work towards building startup companies to scale and sustain their Fellowship projects._ 

___The Code for America Incubator is powered by <a href="http://www.google.com/entrepreneurs" target="_blank">Google for Entrepreneurs</a>._

**The Impact of Hyperlocal Data**
  
As the growing “smart city” movement gains ground, cities are using data captured by sensors, smartphones and more traditional data collection (call centers, surveys) to understand behavioral patterns to improve traffic congestion, government responsiveness, public services, and emergency management. This data can help us run our cities better, but it can also provide a powerful tool for connecting, building and growing communities in urban planning and policy-making processes. By eliminating barriers to entry to produce data-driven maps and reports, LocalData helps anyone produce and understand community information. Big decisions are being made on where investment should go and how it should be spent — decisions that define who benefits from the distribution of urban development, where attention to blight is placed, and the development of new businesses and homes. These decisions can completely alter the economic future and livability of our communities.

**Incubation
  
** Over the past six months, the LocalData team has had the privilege of growing alongside two inaugural incubator teams, all formerly Code for America Fellows. In addition to learning the ins and outs of payroll, incorporation and the joy of receiving our first paid invoice, we grew as entrepreneurs, researchers, and product developers. We’re proud to have worked with dozens of partner organizations ranging from world-class institutions like University of Chicago and Harvard University to small, grassroots community-based organizations in places like Gary, Ind. and Detroit on using data to make better places. We have actively established relationships with more than 900 prospective partner institutions ranging from community-based and neighborhood groups, national technical assistance providers in community development, urban planning firms, and municipal government agencies. Of those partner groups, we identified 10 priority partners who successfully deployed LocalData for a diversity of use-cases.

**Supporting Partnerships
  
** In order to amplify the existing data collection and analysis process of advocacy organizations and governments, we needed to support multiple stakeholders. Coalitions dedicated to fighting arson, curbing blight, and growing healthy downtown economies involve universities, governments, and non-profits. LocalData provides the platform for that work to take place with multiple stakeholder groups. Here’s a snapshot of just a few of the fantastic partners with projects powered by LocalData with over the course of the Code for America Incubator:

> &#8220;_If we don&#8217;t do this work and get the data to revitalize our community, no one else will_&#8221;
  
> — Nortown Community Development Corporation, Detroit

**<a href="http://www.mapc.org" target="_blank">Metropolitan Area Planning Council</a> + Town of Lynn, Mass.
  
** Metropolitan Area Planning Council (MAPC) is a public regional planning authority that serves 100 towns across Massachusetts. We worked with MAPC and the Town of Lynn, Mass. to use data to make strategic recommendations for central business district economic development.

Lynn’s Central Business District was surveyed to better understand where buildings are and what condition they’re in, and where concentrations of these businesses lie. The data was used to produce maps and inform recommendations for a strategic visioning document and became part of a new interactive property database for citizens and cities. The larger project is funded by the federal HUD Sustainable Communities Grant.

**<a href="http://www.placeeconomics.com/" target="_blank">PlaceEconomics</a> and University of Pennsylvania, City of Muncie, Ind., Ball State University**
  
Over the course of three days, this academic, consulting, and public sector partnership collected detailed parcel-level information on the condition, type and historic value of properties in their target area to inform a historical preservation rightsizing initiative. By combining the data they produced with census data on demographics, crime records, and demolitions they produced a strategic document to inform what properties to focus on saving and what to demolish in this area.

**<a href="http://www.gsd.harvard.edu/#/news/plan-downtown-malden-core-urban-planning-studio-hits-the-streets.html" target="_blank">Harvard University Graduate School of Design + City of Malden, Mass.</a>
  
** Harvard University&#8217;s Graduate School of Design and Malden, Mass. mapped patterns of nighttime activity auditing streets at night to collect data on where people gather (and don’t). They also documented where streetlights were located and other indicators to better understand assets and challenges in growing Malden’s night-time economy. The data gathered in this study was used in Malden’s new Master Plan.

**City of Houston Finance Department + Health and Human Service Department
  
** A variety of inspections happen in the City of Houston from inspecting restaurants for health violations to enforcing building code. Generally, these violations may fall into different city departments while occurring in a singular physical location. In an experimental pilot, LocalData was used to by Health and Human Services employees to collect data for health and human services and information for alternate departments to document restaurant health code violations as well as permit and signage code enforcement. The City effectively used LocalData to collect high quality code violation information for multiple departments at a single address improving inter-departmental efficiency and code enforcement to better serve citizens.

**<a href="http://cfsem.org/" target="_blank">Community Foundation of Southeast Michigan: ModeShift Bike Count</a>**
  
This regional community foundation supports ModeShift, a web-based journalism project dedicated to understanding Detroit and Southeast Michigan&#8217;s regional transportation network and urban issues sought to understand use of bicycles as transportation mode in SE Michigan. We are working with CFSEM to collect data on where bicycles are in Detroit, demographic data on who is biking (gender) and the kind of transportation mode people are using. This data will be used to help inform the public and CFSEM around bicycle usage and to measure changes in ridership over time.
