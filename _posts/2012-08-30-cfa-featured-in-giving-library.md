We&#8217;re thrilled that Code for America&#8217;s work is being featured by the newly-launched <a href="http://www.givinglibrary.org/" target="_blank">Laura and John Arnold Foundation Giving Library</a>. Out of more than 250 non-profit organizations, Code for America was selected to be spotlighted as the Foundation promotes the Giving Library and Connection Center. The library is an unique resource providing information about non-profit organizations through video interviews, and enables philanthropists to communicate directly with participating organizations like CfA.

Our Executive Director Jen Pahlka filmed an extensive Q&A session to provide more information about Code for America, the cities we work with, and our metrics for success. Check out the <a href="http://www.givinglibrary.org/organizations/code-america" target="_blank">full video interview</a> with Jen at the Giving Library:

The Arnolds signed Bill Gates’ and Warren Buffet’s <a href="http://givingpledge.org/" target="_blank">Giving Pledge</a> in 2010, and have been working to help other philanthropists and foundations be strategic, thoughtful and engaged in their giving. Our efforts align with their giving strategy &#8211; they fund efforts in _areas of society in which underperformance, inefficiency, concentrated power, lack of information, lack of accountability, lack of transparency, lack of balance among interests or other barriers to human progress and achievement exist_, and value a _rigorous and comprehensive entrepreneurial problem-solving approach_.

We are enthusiastic about working with other partners who seek to give strategically, and look forward to talking with those who learn about CfA through the new Giving Library.
