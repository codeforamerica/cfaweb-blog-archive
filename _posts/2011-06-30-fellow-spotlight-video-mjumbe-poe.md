I did a [video about Karla Macedo](http://codeforamerica.org/2011/04/14/karla-video/), another fellow, a few months ago, and getting to know each of these fellows better, and share their perspective is one of my favorite things to do. In my conversation with Mjumbe, it became clear that he has always been fascinated by technology and that he is deeply optimistic about its potential to transform society. But donâ€™t take it from me. Hear what he has to say:
