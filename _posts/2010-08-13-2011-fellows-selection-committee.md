It&#8217;s the best kind of problem to have. We have received hundreds of applications for our [fellowship](http://codeforamerica.org/fellows) &#8212; hopefully even [more](http://codeforamerica.org/apply) by our August 15 deadline &#8212; and starting next week we will have to select just 20-25 fellows from that impressive pool for next year. Fortunately, we&#8217;re going to have some help. Leaders from both the tech industry and government have agreed to help us review candidates and ensure we&#8217;re getting the best people for the job. We are thrilled to have the input of such a diverse, experienced, and knowledgeable group:
