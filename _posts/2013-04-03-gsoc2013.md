Google Summer of Code is a great way to get involved with Code for America. Find out more from Google about the [GSoC program](https://developers.google.com/open-source/soc/).

Code for America&#8217;s GSoC program is being run by Mick Thompson <mick at codeforamerica.org>. Email him with any questions.

Throughout the program we encourage you to discuss your ideas on our github: <https://github.com/codeforamerica/dev> start a new [issue](https://github.com/codeforamerica/dev/issues) to discuss your proposal.

**Students**

Student application period opens April 22 and ends on May 3.

Here is what we are looking for in a proposal:

  * A clear concrete idea along with the tasked needed to make the idea a success.
  * Tell us about you. Show use what you have done in the past so we can see you are able to complete the project
  * Provide a schedule with major milestones so your mentor knows when to expect things to be done.

### Ideas:

Extend an existing Code for America project, or work on something reusable for civic developers. See a  [list of ideas on github](https://github.com/codeforamerica/dev/blob/master/gsoc2013.md) Then please discuss your proposal in that github repo by starting a new [issue](https://github.com/codeforamerica/dev/issues)
