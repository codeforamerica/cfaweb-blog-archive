[<img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2125" title="gift" src="http://codeforamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/gift-300x198.gif" alt="" />](http://bit.ly/cfa-gift10)The holidays can be exciting times with lots to do. Our small team here at Code for America is feeling the holiday spirit, and also the crunch! In just a few weeks, we will welcome the inaugural class of CfA Fellows. These brave and talented souls will really begin to bring our mission to life, working hand in hand with staff in cities to help make government more efficient and open. But to set them up for success, we need [your help](http://bit.ly/cfa-gift10)!

We&#8217;ll be spending the month of January outfitting our office so the fellows will have a place to collaborate, learn, and build new kinds of solutions for citizens and governments. We&#8217;re brand new, so we&#8217;re missing some of the basics, like chairs, monitors, and a conference table. We know that as the year closes out, many of you are looking for worthy charities to support. Will you consider [making a tax-deductible donation](http://bit.ly/cfa-gift10) to Code for America to help us create a space for this important, game-changing work?

While we welcome a donation of any amount, you can take this opportunity to sponsor a tangible piece of our new workspace, [your holiday gift to the Code for America movement](http://bit.ly/cfa-gift10).

**_Our Holiday Wish List_**

  * [<img class="size-full wp-image-2123 alignright" title="donate-simple2" src="http://codeforamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/donate-simple2.png" alt="" />](http://bit.ly/cfa-gift10)$50: a keyboard for one fellow
  * $100: a chair for one fellow
  * $180: an external monitor for one fellow
  * $300: LCD projector for our educational room
  * $500: airfare for a Fellow to and from their host city
  * $1000: a conference table for team meetings

Donations at any level are appreciated, and of course, we welcome your [in-kind donations](http://codeforamerica.org/supplies). The work of the Code for America Fellows relies on a belief that a group of passionate people can make a difference. If you share that belief, won&#8217;t you please help us bring it to life?<!--more-->

Thank you so much for all the support and encouragement you&#8217;ve given us this year, and we wish you and yours the best this holiday season.

PS: We&#8217;re planning a housewarming in January, and anyone in the Bay Area will be welcome. So buy a fellow a monitor today, and come see it in action next month!
