  Code for America&#8217;s second <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/accelerator-2013/"> Accelerator</a> year kicked off yesterday. The first day’s schedule was packed with a day-long facilitation session led by Allen “Gunner” from Aspiration Tech. The day’s highlights included: product pitches, breakout sessions, company q&a’s, and a lunch discussion with Tim O’Reilly.

What better way to celebrate the end of a long work day, than in typical CfA style, with snacks and mingling around the kegerator? The night’s mixer was well attended by all branches of the CfA family tree&#8211;staff, 2013 fellows, and incubator companies all stopped by to chat with the Accelerator companies.

“_Where are the cops_?”, a staff member asked excitedly, while scanning the room. She was of course referring to the founders of [StreetCred Software](http://streetcredsoftware.com/), who by day are two police officers from Texas.

Everyone was in good spirits as the different teams zipped up their track jackets and posed for pictures. Sarayu from [FAF](http://www.familyassessmentform.com/) struck some model poses while those from [ArchiveSocial](http://archivesocial.com/) ducked into the bathroom to do some hurried preening.
  
It’s already quite apparent how much energy this year’s Accelerator class will bring to our space. Welcome everyone&#8211;we’re thrilled you’ve joined the family!
