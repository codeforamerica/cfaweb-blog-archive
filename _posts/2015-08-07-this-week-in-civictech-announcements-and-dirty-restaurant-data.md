More than [28,000](http://code-for-america-brigade.meetup.com/) people around the globe help make their communities and governments work better through the [Code for America network](http://www.codeforamerica.org/brigade/). Here&#8217;s a brief snapshot of what happened across the network this week:

### Chicago Uses Data Science to Find Dirty Restaurants Faster

Chicago&#8217;s Department of Public Health and local partners used a combination of datasets to [change the order in which they inspect restaurants](http://chicago.github.io/food-inspections-evaluation/). They now [find violations seven days earlier](http://datasmart.ash.harvard.edu/news/article/delivering-faster-results-with-food-inspection-forecasting-631) than before.

### Bloomberg&#8217;s What Works Cities Announced

Eight partner cities, including former Fellowship and Brigade cities, for former NYC Mayor Bloomberg&#8217;s new program on open data [have been announced](http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/8-cities-win-open-data-contest-from-ex-nyc-mayor-bloomberg/2015/08/05/29d1a8e0-3b27-11e5-b34f-4e0a1e3a3bf9_story.html).

### Knight Prototype Fund Winners Announced

A [whole bunch](http://www.knightfoundation.org/blogs/knightblog/2015/8/4/22-ideas-win-knight-prototype-fund-support/) of new and interesting projects were just funded by the Knight Foundation&#8217;s popular prototyping fund, including several Brigade-led civic tech projects.

### Start Up in a Day Winning Cities Announced

The White House&#8217;s Start Up in a Day winning cities [get their shine](http://https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2015/08/04/startup-day-four-things-you-should-know). LA won the big prize, with many other Brigade cities involved as well. The White House also just threw its first [Demo Day](https://www.whitehouse.gov/demo-day) this week.

### DataSF Publishes Plans for 2016

DataSF publishes its [Year 2 Plan](http://datasf.org/blog/announcing-our-year-2-plan/) including an [In Progress Dashboard](http://datasf.org/progress/).

### Australia&#8217;s Huge GovHack

[GovHack](https://www.govhack.org/) is Australia&#8217;s largest civic tech hackathon series. Our favorite project this year was this [Melbourne Dashboard](http://melbourne.yuri.io/), showing you what&#8217;s happening around downtown.
