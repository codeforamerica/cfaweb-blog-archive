When we started working on Brigade we were really excited and we got a lot of other people excited, too. We burst onto the scene with a bunch of activity and a website. Meaningful, sustainable outcomes emerged from our initial sprint. [Open San Diego](http://opensandiego.org "Open San Diego home") deployed Azavea&#8217;s Open Data Catalog and now there are [413 datasets about San Diego](http://catalog.opensandiego.org "OSD's catalog") that are described and discoverable. From that effort [a community of ODC users](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/opendatacatalog-user "ODC Google Group") was formed so implementers in different cities could share knowledge and get help. Now there are three open source, open government platforms that can be evaluated by civic hackers around the country. Code for America Fellow, Jim Craner, is [working with CKAN](http://brigade.codeforamerica.org/applications/16 "brigade app page for ckan") to help get Santa Cruz, CA booted up with a data portal. The [Open Gov Platform](https://github.com/opengovplatform/opengovplatform "github repo") developed in [partnership between The White House and India](http://ogpl.gov.in/US-India-Open-Government-Platform-Launched "news announcement on opengovplatform.org") is now available, and folks in Virginia are organizing around it.

But the Brigade has a much higher calling than hosting hack-a-thons and deploying apps. These are tactics. There is a mission, strategy, and core set of goals that you, [current or future Brigade member](http://brigade.codeforamerica.org/users/sign_up "Sign Up with Brigade"), will be glad to learn.

Code for America&#8217;s mission:

> Helping governments work better for everyone using the people and the power of the web.

Our goals:

  1. _Governments leveraging technology more effectively_
  2. _Citizens and community groups solving civic issues_
  3. _Cities collaborating to work better_
  4. _Apps built on linked, open data_

Our strategy:

To ensure that governments are leveraging technology more effectively our strategy is to drive structural changes in government necessary to update government&#8217;s _approach_ to technology. A great example of this is the Mayor&#8217;s Office of [New Urban Mechanics](http://www.newurbanmechanics.org/ "new urban mechanics home") (MONUM) created by the City of Boston. New York City adopted MONUM organically and Philadelphia is headed there, too. But to grow beyond organic adoption an open source model that can be more easily replicated is needed. Developing that model is work that needs doing. Supporting [open government initiatives](http://opengovernmentinitiative.org "open gov initiative home") is something else Brigades can do to implement this strategy.

To ensure that citizens and community groups are solving civic issues our strategy is to match need with capacity through the Brigade program by sourcing well-qualified opportunities for civic tech and bringing [500 volunteers](http://brigade.codeforamerica.org/users "brigade users") to meet them.

To ensure that cities are collaborating our strategy is to help cities reuse existing apps, either by redeploying them to more cities or by connecting cities to a national service through data standards. We want to see [at least 40 instances](http://brigade.codeforamerica.org/applications "brigade apps") of that.

To ensure that apps are built on linked, open data, our strategy is to liberate data by the hundreds and thousands of datasets. It&#8217;s not too daunting a task. Just ask Open San Diego. They&#8217;ll probably help, too. That&#8217;s the Brigade effect.
