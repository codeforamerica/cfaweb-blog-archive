If you&#8217;re a civic hacker then you know nothing brings developers together like the shared experience of solving a hard problem. But for you, &#8220;solving problems&#8221; is probably almost synonymous with &#8220;writing code.&#8221; What&#8217;s not always clear is how people who aren&#8217;t developers can work with Brigades to aid with pressing civic issues.

One of the great things about the project I work on, [LocalWiki](http://localwiki.org), is that it&#8217;s not at it&#8217;s core a hacking project. We encourage you to [hack it](http://github.com/localwiki/localwiki). LocalWiki has enabled people to **document everything in their community** — [local news](http://daviswiki.org/November_18%2C_2011_UC_Davis_Police_Response_to_Occupy_UC_Davis) and [local history](http://daviswiki.org/Tank_house) to [lost pets](http://daviswiki.org/Lost_pets). Use it to look up just about anything and if it&#8217;s not there simply &#8220;add a page&#8221; — who knew hacking was this easy!

In the same way that hacking with friends brings you together, LocalWiki has brought communities together with a shared purpose and goal. I believe that we all have a deep, fundamental desire to share and help our community. But people want to know their time and effort is valued — that it&#8217;s part of something larger, something that can benefit their community for years to come. And people want to know they can contribute just a little bit and have it help.

With that in mind, I want to give you a couple of recent examples of ordinary people hanging out, having fun, and building LocalWiki projects.

## San Francisco Parklet Ride

A couple weeks ago we were slated to have an absolutely beautiful weekend here in San Francisco, and I thought, &#8220;you know, it&#8217;s gonna be a beautiful weekend — it&#8217;d be great if we could just bike around, take pictures, enjoy the beautiful day, and at the end of the day get on our laptops and work on the soon-to-be-launched [SF LocalWiki](https://sfwiki.org) project&#8221;

So I just threw up a Facebook event, invited some friends and came up with a little plan: document all the [parklets](https://sfwiki.org/Parklets) we encountered on our bike ride through the city.

At the end of the day we&#8217;d made a few pages on our LocalWiki, but more importantly, we shared a fun experience together.

## Kitchener LocalWiki Workshop

This is Steve:

&nbsp;

Steve&#8217;s an artist who does really amazing projects like [SelfControl](http://visitsteve.com/made/selfcontrol/), [AddArt](http://visitsteve.com/made/add-art-art-replaces-ads/), and [Capitalism Works For Me! True/False](http://visitsteve.com/made/capitalism-works-for-me-truefalse/).

Last week, Steve got together with [CAFKA](http://cafka.org/), a public space art organization, and held [a two-evening workshop for artists and residents](http://cafka.org/event/kitchener-wiki-workshop) in Kitchener, Ontario on building a [LocalWiki for Kitchener](http://kitchenerwiki.org).

[<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-13793" title="4h6atkruxubnr1p9 (1)" src="http://codeforamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/4h6atkruxubnr1p9-1-300x199.jpg" alt="" />](http://codeforamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/4h6atkruxubnr1p9-1.jpg)[<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-13792" title="2bk22d00ypg4odhk" src="http://codeforamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/2bk22d00ypg4odhk-300x199.jpg" alt="" />](http://codeforamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/2bk22d00ypg4odhk.jpg)

After starting out with the basics of how LocalWiki works, the workshop immediately got people out into the streets — participants toured the city, collecting information about their favorite places, insider tips, and popular spots. After running about, everybody reconvened and had a big LocalWiki writing party at the art center.

With [more than 221 pages, 167 photos, and 130 maps](http://kitchenerwiki.org/tools/dashboard) in just a few days, the [KitchenerWiki project](http://kitchenerwiki.org) is off to a great start!
