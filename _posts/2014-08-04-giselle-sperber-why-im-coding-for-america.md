Why am I coding for America? All the big reasons: to help government serve the neediest citizens, to improve transportation and livability, and to assist cities as they grow. I chose to spend a year as a Fellow with Code for America because I want to help.

But the real reason I’m coding for America? A simple online form. The application form for the Code for America Fellowship. You see, the form started off with a blank for my name. No problem! Then it asked me easy, short questions. Then, as it asked longer answers, it let me know the maximum number of words. But most of all, it promised me upfront it would only take me two hours to complete. I wasn’t a hundred percent sure I would pursue the Fellowship, but two hours, why not?

So I filled out the form. Then I got an email. I’d made it to the next round, could I do a quick video interview? I got to record the interview when I had the time and in the comfort of my home. The process took longer than the form, but was easy and clear. I was getting more curious about Code for America. To prep for the interview I read everything I could find.

Then, the exciting news: the final round, and an in-person conversation. A long day of interviewing. Now this was a serious investment of time. But at this point I was interested and committed. I’d been hooked by a well-designed application process!

So, yes, I’m coding for America for the big important reasons, but also because **simple, usable technology can change people’s lives**. Something as simple as an easy-to-fill-out form moved me across the country to a new role with Code for America; and brought me new challenges making technology easier to use, more intuitive, and fair for all.
