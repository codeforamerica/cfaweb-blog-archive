Code for America was featured in _Governing Magazine&#8217;s_ January issue in the article, [&#8220;Local Coders Help Improve Government Functions.&#8221;](http://www.governing.com/topics/technology/local-coders-help-improve-government-functions.html) The article focuses on how the city of Boston is leveraging new technologies and opportunities, including the CfA fellowship, to improve the quality of life for its citizens. The city&#8217;s CIO, Bill Oates, was interviewed and described his reason for participating in the [CfA City Program](http://codeforamerica.org/cities):

> “Try to think about the number of resources we’re going to have, the length of time that we’re going to have them, the quality of the resources,” Oates says. “And if you look at that and what we will end up paying from a city perspective on that, I think it’s [Code for America's] great value. There’s no question in my mind that this is going to be great value for the city&#8230;&#8221;

> “When you see CfA, when you see open application development and inviting developers to come in and help, I think it’s just a reaction to the challenges we have,” he says. “We are now to the point where we’ve seen some success with innovation and change, and that just breeds more interest to do it more.”
