On Friday December 18th, California held its second vendor forum for the Child Welfare Services project. Part 1 of my recap covers the [first vendor forum](http://www.codeforamerica.org/blog/2015/12/23/recapping-the-california-child-welfare-technology-vendor-forums-part-1/).

The materials for the second vendor forum are now up at the [Child Welfare Services &#8211; New System](https://cwscms.osi.ca.gov/New-System) website, as well as links to the first two RFPs:

  * [Child Welfare Services Project:  Vendor Forum Webinar Presentation](https://cwscms.osi.ca.gov/Portals/0/public/new_system/12.18.15_Vendor_Forum_Webinar_Slides.pdf) [pdf]
  * [Child Welfare Services Project: Second Vendor Forum Recording](https://cwscms.osi.ca.gov/Portals/0/public/new_system/12.18.15_Vendor_Forum_Webinar_Recording.mp4) [mp4 screencast]

California has also published the [in-person attendee list of the first forum](https://cwscms.osi.ca.gov/Portals/0/public/new_system/12.4.15_CWS_Vendor_Forum_In-Person_List.pdf) [pdf].

The 2nd vendor forum presentation covers, as I understand it, questions that were emailed to the California team at [CWS-NSP@osi.ca.gov](mailto:CWS-NSP@osi.ca.gov%20) after the first vendor forum.

I&#8217;m not going to recap the whole presentation &#8211; this time it clocks in at 54(!) pages. Instead, I&#8217;ll pick out from each section of the presentation the bits that I think are good/interesting/worth commenting on.

## Doing business with the state

This section included issues like whether companies that aren&#8217;t based in California would be able to bid. Good news! You don&#8217;t have to be a California-based business to bid, but you do have to [register to do business with the state](https://caleprocure.ca.gov/pages/bidder-vendor.aspx).

I think, if vendors have issues with the registration process, they should be able to contact <cws-nsp@osi.ca.gov> for help.

## About the procurement

Most of the questions about the RFPs are covered now that first two RFPs have been published on Bidsync ([Intake RFP](https://www.bidsync.com/bidsync-app-web/vendor/links/BidDetail.xhtml?bidid=1992783&returnPage=searchResults), [API/Platform RFP](https://www.bidsync.com/bidsync-app-web/vendor/links/BidDetail.xhtml?bidid=1992784&returnPage=searchResults)), but here&#8217;s an interesting slide:

<div id="attachment_34852" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">
  <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/12.18.15_Vendor_Forum_Webinar_Slides-7.png"><img class="wp-image-34852 size-full" src="http://www.codeforamerica.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/12.18.15_Vendor_Forum_Webinar_Slides-7.png" alt="A question about whether the RFPs will ask for working code or prototypes." /></a>
  
  <p class="wp-caption-text">
    Slide 7: Responding to the RFP
  </p>
</div>

Some points to note:

  * No, the state isn&#8217;t requiring working code or prototypes in vendors&#8217; bids, but
  * Bidders <span style="text-decoration: underline;">can</span> demonstrate capability and skill by submitting working code or prototypes

This is in contrast to something like [18F&#8217;s Agile Blanket Purchase Agreement](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/08/28/announcing-the-agile-BPA-awards/) process that required vendors to demonstrate agile development capability by, er, actually doing some agile development. I \*imagine\* that, all things being equal, a vendor who demonstrates capability and skill with working code/prototypes will be more persuasive than a vendor who doesn&#8217;t. [Note: while I have been working with California and their Federal partners on this effort, I'm not a State employee and so can't be and will not be on the evaluation team]

On when the additional RFPs are going to come out:

  <p class="wp-caption-text">
    Slide 11: Issuing More RFPs
  </p>
</div>

Two more RFPs &#8211; extensions for the Platform/API module and an RFP for the Children&#8217;s Residential Licensing module are expected to be issued in the first half of 2016.

## Open government

This section was super exciting to me. It&#8217;s a great example of the direction that government technology is moving and is an area in which California is definitely taking the lead. Other states, take note!

First off:

<div id="attachment_34859" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">
  <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/12.18.15_Vendor_Forum_Webinar_Slides-14.png"><img class="wp-image-34859 size-full" src="http://www.codeforamerica.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/12.18.15_Vendor_Forum_Webinar_Slides-14.png" alt="A question about the process committing to open source and open standards for development and delivery." /></a>
  
  <p class="wp-caption-text">
    Slide 14: Open Source and Open Standards
  </p>
</div>

This is a big deal. I got a bit carried away when I [tweeted this on the day](https://twitter.com/hondanhon/status/677976976397746176) (the clarification is that **this project** in California is committing to open source and open standards &#8211; it wasn&#8217;t a state-wide technology policy announcement), but the main points are that the Child Welfare Service will use:

  * open standards
  * commodity open source components
  * commodity open source tools

when they&#8217;re available.

Also, &#8220;**all new source code will be made open and reusable and published with an appropriate license.**&#8221;

To make sure the point wasn&#8217;t missed, &#8220;**we intend to release the code created under this effort as an open-source product**.&#8221;

This was followed up with a slide about intellectual property and ownership:

<div id="attachment_34860" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">
  <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/12.18.15_Vendor_Forum_Webinar_Slides-15.png"><img class="wp-image-34860 size-full" src="http://www.codeforamerica.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/12.18.15_Vendor_Forum_Webinar_Slides-15.png" alt="A slide about ownership of the product created through this effort." /></a>
  
  <p class="wp-caption-text">
    Slide 15: Ownership, licensing and open source
  </p>
</div>

California and the federal government will own the products (including, for example, API and Intake module work and documentation like user interface guidelines, design standards and pattern libraries) and &#8220;**intends to provide an open source license to the products created or modified as part of this procurement&#8221;.**

To me, this means that as part of this procurement a **lot** of useful, valuable information is going to become available for others to build upon and use, which is a fantastic win for taxpayers and the government community.

The next slide, though, was one of my favourites:

<div id="attachment_34861" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">
  <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/12.18.15_Vendor_Forum_Webinar_Slides-16.png"><img class="wp-image-34861 size-full" src="http://www.codeforamerica.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/12.18.15_Vendor_Forum_Webinar_Slides-16.png" alt="A question about how much work will be done in public, e.g. with a public git repository with working demos online." /></a>
  
  <p class="wp-caption-text">
    Slide 16: Working in the open
  </p>
</div>

&#8220;The State will default to open&#8221; was a remark that I saw someone in a Code for America Slack channel say that they&#8217;d like on a t-shirt, and it&#8217;s an amazing, progressive sentiment and policy. To me, this indicates that California expects that most &#8211; if not all! &#8211; of the work on this project will be done on the project. The wording in the slide that:

>           <span style="color: rgb(34.901962%, 34.901962%, 34.901962%);">The State is not opposed to working in public, provided appropriate and reasonable privacy and security requirements have been met, given the sensitive nature of Child Welfare. The State believes that we should share the progress and work of this project whenever we can, with colleagues, users and the world. This extends to sharing code, designs, ideas, intentions and failures. The more eyes there are on a service, the better it gets: mistakes are spotted, better alternatives can be suggested and the bar is raised for everyone. </span>

          might be familiar to people who&#8217;ve read through the United Kingdom&#8217;s Government Digital Service <a href="https://www.gov.uk/design-principles#tenth">Design Principles</a>. The next and last slide in this section covered the issue that existing non-disclosure agreements are still in force until they&#8217;re changed and that some information will obviously (and sensibly) need to be kept confidential given the nature of the project.

        <h2>
          User research
        </h2>
        
        <p>
          Peter Kelly, who was the voice of the California Team during this vendor forum, opened this section by saying that there was a surprising <strong>lack</strong> of questions about user research, considering how the team had emphasized how important user research and meeting user needs was in the <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/blog/2015/12/23/recapping-the-california-child-welfare-technology-vendor-forums-part-1/">first vendor forum</a>.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          That said, this part was good and worth noting:
        </p>
        
        <div id="attachment_34865" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

          <p class="wp-caption-text">
            Slide 20: Design and User Interface
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

</div>

I like how California answered this one. The question was relatively narrow:

> Q: Is it the goal of the State to ensure a consistent look and feel across the multiple modules?

If I were being uncharitable, I&#8217;d view this question as a possible fishing expedition from a vendor who would&#8217;ve preferred a monolithic approach. This isn&#8217;t quite as bad as a &#8220;have you stopped beating your wife yet?&#8221; for which the question is a trap and there is no good answer, but the answer in this case is clearly &#8220;yes, of course the state wants a consistent look and feel across multiple modules&#8221;. You can imagine the argument that the best way to achieve a consistent look and feel would for the entire service to be supplied by one vendor. But! That&#8217;s a trap: relying on a single vendor is just **one** way to ensure a consistent look and feel.

Instead, California zooms out and tries to **consider what the intent of the question is**. A consistent look and feel is just one way to ensure that users have their needs met: that they can rely on predictable behaviour and interaction methods across different services. So it&#8217;s great to see that the state answers the question like this:

> A: It is important to remember that the State has an explicit goal that the new Child Welfare Service be **simple and intuitive enough that users succeed first time unaided**. This means that a consistent look and feel across multiple modules is desirable. [my emphasis]

  <div class="section">
    <div class="layoutArea">
      <div class="column">
        <p>
          This is a <strong>great</strong> answer. It takes inspiration from the direction established by the <a href="https://playbook.cio.gov/#play3">U.S. Digital Service</a>, the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/digital-by-default">UK government</a> and the <a href="https://www.dto.gov.au/standard/digital-transformation-plan">Australian government</a> in saying that services need to be <strong>simple and intuitive enough</strong> <strong>that users succeed first time unaided</strong>.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

Secondly, it looks like California is using the Child Welfare Service project as a way to kickstart a design standard and design guidelines by saying that the State is going to collaborate with vendors in producing **a design and user interface standard, guidelines [and] pattern library** to be used across modules.

All of this gets to the answer of the actual question, as well as providing wider context: yes, a consistent look and feel across multiple modules is desirable. But, in the manner of a user story, a consistent look and feel across modules is desirable **so that** users can succeed first-time unaided **because** the service is being designed to meet the needs of its users.

The next few slides in this section clarified that users of the Intake module will be county and state employees/users as well a reporting function for the public to use. Also, the scope of the Intake module is covered in existing State regulations at Div. 31-100 and 31-110.

Another question and answer set was like this:

> <div class="page" title="Page 26">
>   <div class="section">
>     <div class="layoutArea">
>       <div class="column">
>         <p>
>           <span style="color: rgb(34.901962%, 34.901962%, 34.901962%);">Q: Are you targeting an API for system-to-system integration, integration with mobile applications, or both?</span>
>         </p>
>       </div>
>     </div>
>   </div>
> </div>

<div class="page" title="Page 26">
  <div class="section">
    <div class="layoutArea">
      <div class="column">
        <p>
          Again, the state&#8217;s answer was less about the actual question and more about the overall context. It&#8217;s my understanding that the API isn&#8217;t just being used for system to system integration (and I&#8217;m not sure what that means, exactly: perhaps multiple back-end systems?) or with &#8220;mobile applications&#8221; &#8211; because the latter betrays thinking about the role that a modern application programming interface can fulfill. An API can be used by many things &#8211; whether it&#8217;s badly or well designed. Instead, California answered like this:
        </p>
        
        <div class="page" title="Page 26">
          <div class="section">
            <div class="layoutArea">
              <div class="column">
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    <span style="color: rgb(34.901962%, 34.901962%, 34.901962%);">A: Both. We are targeting an API for system-to-system integration. <strong>The API does not specify in particular the types of systems that the API will be used with on the client side (e.g. “mobile applications”) other than the API be open and RESTful</strong>. For example, <strong>the API developed for Intake may provide functionality for other back-end services, or for front-end services.</strong></span>
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                
                <p>
                  There were some specific questions about how Intake module development would work with API development. The forum made clear that <strong>Intake module work (other than user research and discovery phases) would be dependent upon functionality provided by the API</strong>.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                  A question about platforms and dependencies showed how California is thinking how the platform is expected to work in the short-term and in the future:

                <p>
                  Most of the answers to these types of questions were along the lines of saying that there will be a &#8220;high-level product vision and short-term user needs that must be met&#8221;, and that the RFP when released should answer questions about platform dependencies and restrictions. The Intake module will need to work with the legacy system and database, but through the Platform API. California expects &#8220;<strong>the intake module team to collaborate with the Platform module team to agree and deliver API functionality iteratively, on a sprint basis&#8221;</strong>.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                  Questions about the legacy, enterprise mainframe system were mainly answered by referring to information and documentation, like entity relationship diagrams, that are part of the RFP and the bidder&#8217;s library.

                <p>
                  There was a specific question about using software-as-a-service:

                <div id="attachment_34932" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

                <p>
                  California&#8217;s answer about being open to using software as a service was that:
                </p>
                
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    There may be components of the new CWS-NS could be serviced by SaaS solutions. However, any proposed system must be flexible enough for the State to be able to regularly and frequently improve and change its functionality and operation in order to better meet its users’ needs, whether through configuration, customization or new code.
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                
                <p>
                  To me, this means that the priority is making sure that any new service is able to continually evolve and improve to meet users&#8217; needs. My interpretation would be that proposed solutions to modules could certainly make use of software-as-a-service or subscription/cloud software, but that the state expects regular and frequent improvements.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                  That attitude is repeated again in the following slide:

                  My interpretation: California isn&#8217;t specifying a particular approach. In other words, California isn&#8217;t saying: that they want an existing, off-the-shelf system; they&#8217;re not saying that they&#8217;re just procuring design and development services to build a complete new system from scratch; and they&#8217;re not saying that they just want new services to modify an existing system (it&#8217;s not clear whether the question is about California&#8217;s existing system, or any other existing system) to meet needs. Instead, California is again focussing on long-term outcomes: <strong>a service that is designed to meet users&#8217; needs</strong> and is <strong>flexible enough [to] regularly and frequently improve and change its functionality and operation</strong>.

                  Another big point for me was the question about standards and tooling:

                    A: <strong>The State will specify a number of standards and standard tools in the RFPs.</strong> We expect that the first two vendors will collaborate with the State to establish common standards that will be required to implement the first two modules. We expect that <strong>standards and choice of tools will change during the course of development of the new Child Welfare Service.</strong> For example, the standard product backlog task tracker may be changed if a better tool is found. Similarly, we expect that <strong>user interface standards and design pattern libraries will be constantly updated during the course of development</strong>. [my emphasis]

                  A good question: given how the overall service is being broken up into smaller, more manageable pieces, there&#8217;s understandably a question in vendors&#8217; minds about whether an early vendor has the chance to set standards and tools that might (in one view) constrain other vendors in the future. California&#8217;s answer is a good one, too: they will <strong>specify standards and standard tools in RFPs</strong> but they also acknowledge that <strong>standards and choice of tools will change during the course of development</strong>. In other words, California is going to be iterative in how it treats standards and tools. Excitingly, there&#8217;s a hint that California will produce user interface standards and design pattern libraries and make them public.

                  Ok, so maybe I buried the lede. This is a <strong>big, big deal </strong>for how government technology is designed, developed and delivered and another example of California following the lead of the good work done by the <a href="https://playbook.cio.gov">U.S. Digital Service</a>, <a href="https://github.com/18F">18F</a> and UK&#8217;s <a href="https://github.com/alphagov">GDS</a>.

                <p>
                  While this may seem oddly specific, I think the intent here is for the state to set <strong>a </strong>standard at the outset &#8211; rather than, for example, having to deal with a number of different product backlog and issue trackers. The above doesn&#8217;t look like it precludes the state from changing its mind as better tools or services become available, or if there are better ways of meeting the needs of the state and vendors.

                <p>
                  To me, this question sounds like it comes from a background of software/technology development and delivery where a solution is developed, it goes through user acceptance testing, then into a pilot phase, and then it&#8217;s rolled out to all users. I&#8217;d characterise this as a fairly  traditional waterfall software rollout. The problem with this approach is that it really leaves the issue of testing software with users to see if it actually does what they need it to do, or if it solves problems that need solving and <strong>really works</strong> far too late.

Only after alpha and beta phases with live county users will services go live and be made available across the state.

                          In other words, California re-frames the question and says, roughly, <strong>all services will be used by users before they&#8217;re rolled out statewide. </strong>

                          Organizational change is a big deal. Effectively, what the Department for Social Services is doing (along with the Office for Systems Integration) is a big digital government transformation effort. This isn&#8217;t so much about new technology as it is about looking at and improving how people do their work so they can do their jobs better. So, this is important.

                  In this answer, we&#8217;ve got a few important points: that there&#8217;s a new emphasis on user research as a part of organizational change to make sure that the needs of state and county workers are understood; that this user-research capability is intended to be a long-term, internal capability, and again that regardless of organizational change management, the delivered services are expected to be simple and intuitive. Finally, this is a team effort: an existing organizational change management contractor will work closely with the project team.

                  Like the above question about pilot phases, this question and use of the &#8220;maintenance and operations&#8221; phase comes, I think, from a traditional view of software design, development and delivery in government. What normally happens is something like this:

                          In this answer, California is signaling that development will <strong>continue</strong> with operations when services reach 1.0. Instead of behaving like they&#8217;re purchasing a product that will be finished and tweaked, California is acknowledging and signaling that the Child Welfare Service is just that &#8211; a set of digital services that are critical to providing child welfare in California and that will continue to improve and change as needed.

                                  This question is pretty much asking if there will be a system integrator role for a vendor. An alternate and more traditional approach for this kind of government technology (a big system made up of many services that does many jobs) is to hire a system integrator: one vendor who will look after everything for you and whose job it is to make sure that everything works. A disadvantage with that approach is that it means that the customer loses significant control, understanding and direction of the system that&#8217;s being delivered. If you believe that knowledge of and control of technology that&#8217;s critical to your business is something that shouldn&#8217;t be outsourced, then it doesn&#8217;t make sense to go with an outside vendor to such an extent. So this question is asking: who&#8217;s going to do that integration work?
