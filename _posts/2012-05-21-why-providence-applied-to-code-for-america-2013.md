The Office of Mayor Angel Taveras, in close partnership with the City Council, recently established the [Open Providence Commission for Transparency and Accountability](http://www.providenceri.gov/open-government). This public/private partnership, which passed the 15-member Council unanimously and was signed into law by Mayor Taveras, specifically tasked the Commission with designing and proposing a mechanism for democratizing all non-sensitive city data and utilizing technology to dramatically expand the role of civic engagement in city government.

In <a href="http://www.providenceri.com/" target="_blank">Providence, R.I.</a>, we envision a multi-pronged approach to Government 2.0 that fully integrates a new telephone 311 service, a state of the art citizen dashboard, an expanded city services mobile application, and a lobbyist and legislation tracking system, each specifically designed to empower city residents to bypass city bureaucracy and engage directly with relevant data and stakeholders from all city departments.

A typical citizen dashboard or citywide 311 service is two-dimensional, providing a clearinghouse for public information and a streamlined process for city residents to submit queries.  While helpful, we’re mindful that displaying the dates of upcoming hearings or providing a single-stop phone line for residents to report broken streetlights simply automates current practices into an online transaction.  That’s why we envision a comprehensive system that truly reinvents civic engagement.

We envision a 311 service where aggregated non-emergency complaints can help City engineers predict and prevent flash flooding before a storm hits.  We envision an online platform where entire neighborhood blocks can track and measure their volume of haul-away waste.  We envision optimizing waiting time at city stoplights by allowing Providence, R.I. motorists to transmit real time traffic patterns to city traffic engineers via our expanded, GPS enabled mobile app.  And we envision an information clearinghouse where engaged citizens can have full access to the voting history directly with their elected officials – and their lobbyists.

And, because we don’t envision technology for technology’s sake, we envision these systems laying the groundwork for a new culture of data-driven management in City Hall where managers and administrators use real-time information gathering to make smarter, more informed decisions.

In sum, we want a whole new approach to civic engagement and data-driven management, one that sets the bar nationally for transparency and accountability in municipal governance.

That is why we have applied the Code for America 2013 Fellowship Program.  We are excited about the prospect of hosting Code for America Fellows to play a driving role in the development and implementation of these important changes.
