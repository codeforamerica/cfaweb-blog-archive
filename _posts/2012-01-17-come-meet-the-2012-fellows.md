As the 2012 Code for America Fellowship kicks off, we&#8217;d like to bring all of our friends and supporters to together to welcome our new fellows into the program before they head out for their city residencies. So naturally, we&#8217;re throwing a party!

On January 26 at 5:30pm, we&#8217;re hosting an [Open House](http://www.eventbrite.com/edit?msg=1&#038;saved=1&#038;eid=2769330141). Come have a drink and a snack, and learn about their projects, and discuss what comes next.

All are welcome! RSVP below or [on Eventbrite](http://www.eventbrite.com/edit?msg=1&#038;saved=1&#038;eid=2769330141): <http://www.eventbrite.com/edit?msg=1&#038;saved=1&#038;eid=2769330141>

(Note: we hope to host this event at our new offices, but as construction is still underway, we may end up at our current space. RSVP, and we&#8217;ll be sure to keep you up-to-date.)
