While most of the work so far has taken place behind the scenes (talking to cities and foundations, and work on ramping up the organization and applications), we&#8217;re starting off the new year rolling out a new public-facing site.

Over the next few days we&#8217;ll be adding more pages. To keep up with the latest, follow us on twitter [@codeforamerica](http://twitter.com/codeforamerica).
