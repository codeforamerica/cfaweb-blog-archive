19 governments applied for our 2012 program, and it&#8217;s amazing to read about their project ideas, challenges, and passion for changing the way things work. As a growing start-up, we can only work directly with a handful next year, which is why they are selected through a competitive process. To help us evaluate these great proposals, we have put together a committee of government, industry, and thought leaders.

### 2012 Program Selection Committee

  * Susan Christopherson &#8211; NAGW and County of Boulder
  * Carol Coletta &#8211; CEOs for Cities
  * Kevin Curry &#8211; City Camp
  * Andrew Greenhill &#8211; City of Tucson
  * Nigel Jacob &#8211; City of Boston
  * Clay Johnson &#8211; Big Windows Lab
  * Daniel X O&#8217;Neil &#8211; EveryBlock
  * Tim O&#8217;Reilly &#8211; Board of Directors

We&#8217;re honored to have such a diverse and knowledgeable group of individuals helping us choose our partners for 2012.
