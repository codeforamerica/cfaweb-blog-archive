New Urban Mechanics is an agency within Boston&#8217;s Mayor&#8217;s office tasked with finding new approaches to civic innovation focused on delivering transformative City services to Boston’s residents. For all of here at Code for America, it&#8217;s been an honor working with Nigel and Chris on our [Boston](http://codeforamerica.org/boston) projects such as [ClassTalk](http://codeforamerica.org/?cfa_project=classtalk) and [DiscoverBPS](http://codeforamerica.org/?cfa_project=school-selection) this past year, and we&#8217;re happy to see them receive recognition for all of their great work.
