### Headlines

This week we tuned into a video about app for fruit gleaning, read about crowd-funding civic projects, talked to cool folks about a national civic hack day, and found out about a new public process for drafting open data legislation in Pittsburgh, PA.

### 1. <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/pghopendataleg/" target="_blank" data-bitly-type="bitly_hover_card">Pittsburgh Open Data Legislation Wiki</a>

[Code for Pittsburgh Brigade](https://groups.google.com/a/codeforamerica.org/forum/#!forum/pittsburgh-brigade "Brigade Google group") Member Bob Gradek reported on the local Brigade forum that &#8220;Councilman Ricky Burgess (District 9) has introduced Open Data legislation in Pittsburgh City Council. His staff welcomes comment on the <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/pghopendataleg/draft-legislation-wiki" data-bitly-type="bitly_hover_card">draft</a>, which will be up for discussion in September following council recess.&#8221; Bob created and manages [a wiki](https://sites.google.com/site/pghopendataleg/home "PGH Open Data Catalog Wiki") where related information is curated.

### 2. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2ZD0iR-hbk&feature=youtu.be" target="_blank" data-bitly-type="bitly_hover_card">Youth Radio&#8217;s ForageCity App &#8211; YouTube</a>

[Youth Radio](http://www.youthradio.org/ "Youth Radio home") in Oakland, CA posted a tight, brief video explaining how their app works to redistribute excess fruit that otherwise goes to waste. There is a great opportunity to connect this with [fruit gleaning](https://www.google.com/search?q=fruit%20gleaning "Google search for fruit gleaning") programs throughout the country. Check out [Forage City in Commons](http://commons.codeforamerica.org/apps/forage-city "Commons page for Forage City"). [Let us know if you want to deploy it](http://brigade.codeforamerica.org/pages/apps "Brigade apps activity page") where you live.

### 3. [How do we make civic crowdfunding awesome?](http://www.ethanzuckerman.com/blog/2012/08/10/how-do-we-make-civic-crowdfunding-awesome/ "Ethan Zuckerman's blog post")

Crowd-funding civic hacking is something in which we are most interested at Code for America and in the Brigade, specifically. We&#8217;ve seen several crowd-funding startups come and [go](http://www.civicsponsor.org/ "civicsponsor.org"). We&#8217;ve seen [one](http://codeforamerica.org/2012/05/03/kickstarting-art-around-creating-a-community-of-curators/ "Art Around Kickstarter post on CfA blog") or two civic projects not reach their crowd-funding goals. The renowned [Ethan Zuckerman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethan_Zuckerman "Ethan's wiki page") shared his insights into why some efforts fail and what others should do to succeed.

### 4. [Transit App for iOS 6 and Beyond](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/228865951/transit-app-for-ios-6-and-beyond "OpenPlans' Kickstarter for a transit app")

Speaking of crowd-funded civic projects: [Open Plans](http://www.openplans.org "Open Plans' web site") is $10K away from their $25K Kickstarter to both keep and improve transit directions on the iPhone. Go Open Plans, go! Help them out, won&#8217;t you?

### 5. [National Civic Hack Day: Build a Better Government](http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/vote/4382 "SWSX panel picker")

On Monday I spoke with folks from [NASA](http://open.nasa.gov/ "NASA Open"), [Random Hacks of Kindess](http://www.rhok.org/ "RHoK home"), and [Second Muse](http://secondmuse.com/ "Second Muse home") about creating a National Civic Hack Day. Read about the panel proposed for SXSWi to spread the word.

### 6. [Code for America 2012 Fellowship Projects: Demo Webinar](http://cfa2012webinar.eventbrite.com/ "Eventbrite")

Get to know the apps our 2012 Fellows built for their cities during this 1 hour webinar. All of the apps are [all open source](https://github.com/codeforamerica/ "CfA GitHub")!
