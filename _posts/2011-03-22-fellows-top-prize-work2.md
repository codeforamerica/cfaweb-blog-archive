On Sunday, Joel Mahoney and Talin Salway competed and won in the [Work 2.0](https://company.podio.com/hackday/) challenge hosted by API teams from [Cotweet](http://cotweet.com/), [Yammer](http://yammer.com), [Podio](http://www.podio.com), Jexy, [Cohuman](http://www.cohuman.com), and [Mashery](http://www.mashery.com).

Their concept HubBuds is a mashup of the [Github](http://www.github.com) and [Yammer](http://www.yammer.com) APIs. Â It pushes git commits to Yammer and pulls Yammer commentary back in, which allows technical and non-technical team members to stay up-to-date on shared projects. It also translates project activity and likes/dislikes into badges and awards, which helps to maintain team spirit and velocity. In so doing, HubBuds takes Github&#8217;s concept of &#8220;social coding&#8221; a level up.

Congrats to Talin and Joel. HubBuds won them a trip to Denmark!</p>
