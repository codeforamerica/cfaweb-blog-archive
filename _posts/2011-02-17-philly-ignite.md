Last Thursday, Pete Fecteau took the stage at Ignite Philly 7 on behalf of Team Philadelphia to talk about CfA, why he&#8217;s participating, and what we&#8217;re hoping to accomplish in the city. His Ignite, titled &#8220;The Dumbest Person in the Room&#8221;, really got people thinking and the team was able to talk to a lot of people afterwards that have honest interest in the Code for America program. Pete&#8217;s ignite was even chosen as &#8220;Honorable Mention&#8221; for best overall ignite.
