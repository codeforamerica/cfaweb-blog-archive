> Some 25 volunteers showed up to Azavea’s Callowhill offices to devote their Friday to the development of applications based around civic and geospatial data sets that can help Philadelphia citizens. And be created in a day’s time.
> 
> “We’ve got people from all walks,” said Pete Fecteau, 27, one of Code for America’s Philadelphia fellows and organizer of the event. “Developers, designers, researchers and people who don’t even know why they’re here. But they want to be here.”
> 
> Broken up into four teams, the volunteers were given the latter half of the day to brainstorm and develop demos of their directives. Despite the time limitations, the teams were able to develop four applications based on various civic data sets.
