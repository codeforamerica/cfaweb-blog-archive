<img title="pifs" src="http://codeforamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/pifs-150x150.png" alt="" align="left" />The current procurement system makes it notoriously difficult and costly for government to purchase the new kinds of innovative technologies that have transformed the consumer sector over the last decade. But it doesn&#8217;t have to be this way, say [Clay Johnson](https://twitter.com/cjoh) and [Adam Becker](http://ada.mbecker.cc/), two of the inaugural [Presidential Innovation Fellows](http://www.whitehouse.gov/innovationfellows). They&#8217;re trying to tackle this tough issue with their project [RFP-EZ](http://rfpez.sba.gov) — a new app designed to make it easier for government to buy technology from small businesses, and easier for small businesses to sell to government.

&#8220;Government is the largest buyer on earth. Procurement is the law and regulation and process that dictates how that money gets spent,&#8221; said Johnson. &#8220;You can&#8217;t talk about budget or economy without talking honestly about procurement, and that&#8217;s why every American should care about procurement reform. We have to create these systems and change policies in order to make it so that we can deliver more effective citizen services.&#8221;

The RFP-EZ team indicated a few of the challenges with the current procurement system. First of all, there&#8217;s a mismatch of language and terminology between governments issuing the RFP (Request for Proposals) and the people running small companies on the supply side. That disconnect makes it hard for companies to understand where their services could be needed, and the government doesn&#8217;t get bids from the small businesses, who may be the most qualified to do the work.

Additionally, the registration to be eligible to submit a bid can also be forbiddingly burdensome to small businesses —  hundreds of questions that can take hours to complete — and after that, the process of  reviewing and selecting a winning bid can take months and months longer.

&#8220;Yes, we need to reduce prices, but we do that by getting new entrants into the field of government contracting,&#8221; said Johnson.

RFP-EZ seeks to address some of these issues preventing new entrants from disrupting the government IT market with tools like SOWComposer, which allows agencies the templatize the process of composing a Statement of Work, and the RFP-EZ Marketplace, which lets small businesses quickly register and create a profile to submit bids. While still in limited beta, there have been some preliminary promising successes.

&#8220;About 30 minutes after we launched [RFP-EZ], we had our first bid on one of the RFP&#8217;s out there. Just the fact that a vendor was able to register for our site, and write a coherent bid in those 30 minutes — that was unprecedented,&#8221; said Becker. &#8220;It&#8217;s something that could take ten hours with the previous system.&#8221;

Clay Johnson sees the challenges of procurement as common on both local and federal levels. The hope is that RFP EZ can be repurposed in the future to improve procurement at the local level, though currently it&#8217;s only being beta tested with federal agencies. &#8220;We are building a platform for other people to succeed,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Our whole idea in building RFP-EZ from the get go, was building it in such a way that not only federal buyers can use this platform but also cities, state, and local government could use it.&#8221;

The 2013 Fellows from the [Oakland team](http://codeforamerica.org/2013-partners/oakland/) are focusing on enhancing and expediting city procurement process as one of their key outcomes this year, and they are exploring the possibilities of adapting RFP-EZ for city government.
