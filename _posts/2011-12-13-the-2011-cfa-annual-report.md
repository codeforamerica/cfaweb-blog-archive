The Code for America fellows accomplished a lot this year &#8212; not just in terms of code or apps for the CfA cities, but also learnings for the program &#8212; and we couldn&#8217;t be more proud of them. We&#8217;re pleased today to present a snapshot of the year: the [2011 CfA Annual Report](http://codeforamerica.org/2011report) (embedded below):



Many thanks go to CfA&#8217;s communications team, including Abhi Nemani and Lauren Reid, for producing this document in-house in just a few weeks, along with help from Sheila Bapat and Christian Smith-Socaris, who support our development efforts. We hope you enjoy it!
