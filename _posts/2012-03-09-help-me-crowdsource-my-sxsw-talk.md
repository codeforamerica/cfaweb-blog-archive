To be honest, I haven’t finished writing the talk yet. Yes, I know it’s only a few days away and thousands of people are going to see it. I’m a procrastinator.

The upside is there’s still some time to crowdsource some of the talk. What questions do you have for me? What would you like me to cover? I’m going to talk a little bit about why government works the way it does and what can be done about it, a bit about the market for government technology, and a lot about the role of citizenship in all this. I’m going to tell some stories from the first 1.2 years of Code for America. But what do YOU want to hear?
