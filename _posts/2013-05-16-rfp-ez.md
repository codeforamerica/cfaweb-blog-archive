The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy recently issued a [post](http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2013/05/15/rfp-ez-delivers-savings-taxpayers-new-opportunities-small-business) on how online procurement platform [RFP-EZ](https://rfpez.sba.gov) is already saving taxpayers money.  With five pilot contracts used as a proxy for success, RFP-EZ&#8217;s online bids averaged 30 percent lower in price than those received through the traditional procurement platform of FedBizOpps. Over a year, this could translate into millions saved.

In addition to the cost benefit, RFP-EZ also attracted more than 270 businesses who had never before approached the Federal government for a contract. With results like these it&#8217;s no wonder that the project team is already working on RFP-EZ version two.

The announcement comes just days after Presidential Innovation Fellow and RFP-EZ&#8217;s team member Clay Johnson [wrote a three-part series](http://codeforamerica.org/author/clay-johnson/) about government procurement strategies.

&nbsp;

As Johnson and our chief strategist [Abhi Nemani suggest](http://codeforamerica.org/2013/05/07/towards-a-procurement-strategy/), better procurement technology increases transparency and lowers the barrier to entry for competition. While RFP-EZ was created in just six months with the full project code available on [GitHub](https://github.com/presidential-innovation-fellows/rfpez), it&#8217;s services like these that allow vendors to search for government contract opportunities in plain language while also receiving 24-7 insight into competitive offers. The result is that the government receives good value on its services while offering a chance for diverse new innovators to emerge.

In keeping with CfA&#8217;s belief that procurement is a great place to start to improve innovation in our communities, we encourage those civic startups with procurement solutions to consider our accelerator program. If you&#8217;ve been following the federal story and you&#8217;ve got great ideas on how to fix procurement or are looking to disrupt the civic tech industry, apply for to the CfA Accelerator: [codeforamerica.org/accelerator](http://codeforamerica.org/accelerator/#application) by May 31, 2013.
