At Code for America, we want it to be easier for everyone to participate in their government. Twilio helps us do just that.

From making it easier to check the balance of your food assistance card to improving the public feedback process, the [Twilio platform](https://www.twilio.com/), a messaging, voice, video and authentication API, continues to be at the heart of our work.

[CityVoice](https://www.codeforamerica.org/products/cityvoice/#voiceTop) is a call-in system that leverages Twilio to collect public feedback and help government meet residents where they are &#8212; their phones. Greensboro, NC; San Francisco, CA; San Diego, CA; Moro Bay CA; and Canton, GA all used CityVoice in 2015 to collect feedback about everything from how to use public spaces, to how to improve local parks.

Here is what it sounds like when government makes it easy to hear from the people who use parks:



Of all the participants in these six projects, 65 percent- 85 percent said they had never been part of the public feedback process before.

Code for America, in partnership with Twilio, is making it easy to get quick and actionable feedback from the people who want to make their governments work better.

Thanks, Twilio!
