Just over a week ago Code for America hosted its first-ever Summit at SPUR. We spent two days going over all that we’ve learned and all that we’ve built. Gov 2.0 buzz words such as platform, participatory, data-driven decision making, and civic minded filled the air. <img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/zXgPIT3ZhEO-hTbv8iSQe-429I7kgPflnMDrBqUs8KC7J0a2kti_7zJg_55-whn005SYQbC9C8YpbQt52N1ZYonygs6IjcjufoHAEF3HkJMqaLGSSmc" alt="" width="500px;" height="237px;" />
  
_At the beginning of the Summit each person in the room was asked to say three words, no more, no less. Here is the infographic created by [Alex Howard](http://gov20.govfresh.com/code-for-america-summit-showcases-civic-innovation-liveblog/) (_[@digiphile](https://twitter.com/#!/digiphile))_ showing the words put forth by the Summit attendees._

Speakers and innovators shared the stage and with fellows, all telling impressive stories and small anecdotes in a a communal transferring of knowledge to next years group of cities and fellows. We shared our learnings, expectations, and frustrations.

While many of the faces in the crowd were long time CfA friends and supporters, there was also a new set of faces &#8212; the faces of Code for America 2012.

On day two of the Summit I had my first twirl in the spotlight presenting Iconathon. A social design experience that I helped organize with Chach Sikes, also a CfA fellow. Suddenly,  there I was on stage trying to explain two months in less than three minutes, a-la Ingnite. I was nervous at the site of so many civic-minded people, my visuals solely constructed of icons from the Noun Project, I recaped the story of Iconathon. I explained how Iconathon, born from our 20 percent time, and in partnership with the Noun Project, is a nationwide initiative to help communally create a civic symbol suite.

Later that day I participated in a panel with Nigel Jacobs whom I worked with at the City of Boston, Tyler Stalder also a CfA fellow, and Jeff Freidman whom Tyler worked with at the City of Philadelphia. First-off, moderator David Eaves asked us about our initial experience upon landing in our respective cities. We covered everything from the unexpected February weather to the fact that we all wished we had more time to get lost in city hall. We talked about what it was like to meet the people who work so diligently within the walls of city hall &#8212; the people that make the city run. And we all agreed that we as fellows needed to have a better team structure so that when we landed in our cities we could make even more progress during that one month we were embedded in our host city.

The truth is, I was terrified to be onstage and get asked a questions I was unaware of. But like one big family we talked about things that we thought could be different in hopes that next years cities and fellows would make a mental note of the how they could enhance their experiences.

Though we had a great interaction on stage some of the most frank discussions happened in the Summit&#8217;s breakout sessions &#8212; where fellows, foundation partners, current city partners, future city partners all got to speak unhindered about whatever topic had been presented just before. Next years cities had a chance to talk about what Code for America meant to them. How do we get these isolated government departments talking prior to the arrival of fellows? How can we keep the communication channels fresh when they leave?

Although the breakout sessions where the perfect opportunity to mix and mingle I still don’t feel like I had a chance to talk to everyone who was there in support of us. I did, however, get a chance to sit down and talk to Andrew Greenhill who in many ways seems like the Godfather of CfA &#8212; the man who had a vision for different kind of city. In case you haven&#8217;t read Jen’s blog post about how CfA came to be here’s, the <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/2011/09/30/were-two/" target="_blank">link</a>.

In talking with Andrew, I realized just how fortunate we were to be surrounded by such passionate people. These are people who are genuinely invested in making a difference, who want to use technology to help bring people together and solve problems. Sure, technology is our vehicle for change, but it is by no means the only way we want to create change.

The summit was everything I had expected it to be with one exception, though I’ve spent the last few months seeing the fellows work late nights on various projects, some of which were presented at the Summit, such as: Adopt a Hydrant, ClassTalk, Where’s My School Bus, CityGroups, Open311 Dashboard, SnapFresh, I did not anticipate the my misty-eyed reaction to seeing them all on the stage showcasing their creations. I came to realize that these people had practically become family over the past few months. And now, as our fellowship is coming to a close, we are all headed off in different directions. In a lot of ways it felt like graduation day.

Like every good conference, we celebrated. When the curtain closed on CfA Summit 2011, current and future fellows took the short walk back to the CfA office to get to know each other a bit better over a few cold beers. After all the 2012 fellows introduced themselves and shared his/her aspirations for next year I realized I need a five minute power nap. I found the all too inviting been bag chair, and to my surprise, woke up two hours later. I was exhaused from two exhilarating days at the CfA Summit and was ready to call it a night.
