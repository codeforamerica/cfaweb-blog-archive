Since 2012, each February, Code for America has gathered in communities across the country to <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/2013/03/13/code-across-its-a-wrap/" target="_blank">Code Across America</a>. This February, we&#8217;re doing it again, but this time, we&#8217;re going worldwide.

Join your us, join your neighbors February 21-23 and together, let&#8217;s <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/codeacross-2014" target="_blank">CodeAcross</a> the world.

CodeAcross 2014 is a weekend full of events that are taking place in cities around the world. There will be events hosted simultaneously in dozens of cities from San Francisco to San Antonio,  Mexico City to Porto Alegre, Brazil. Let&#8217;s encourage and inspire residents everywhere to get actively involved in their community.

CodeAcross events will be hosted by members of the CfA network: Fellows, government partners, and volunteers. Find an <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/codeacross-2014" target="_blank">event near you</a>, or if there isn&#8217;t an event nearby, <a href="https://codeforamerica.wufoo.com/forms/zupbs6s1kszbyk/" target="_blank">sign up to organize one</a> (and come join us this Thursday for the <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/e/codeacross-2014-organizer-kickoff-tickets-9912009086" target="_blank">CodeAcross 2014 Organizer Kickoff Hangout</a>).

This year, since CodeAcross is coinciding with International Open Data Day, we’re offering a theme: Beyond Transparency. Let’s take the open government movement one step further, by focusing on not only making data open, but making it actionable. Join us to push the ball forward in your community.

What is “Beyond Transparency?” Beyond Transparency is a call to action for local governments, civic technologists, and the community to figure how open data can be used as the raw materials to drive more effective decision-making and efficient service delivery, spur economic activity, and empower citizens to take an active role in improving their own communities.

Who should get involved in CodeAcross? Urbanists, civic hackers, government staff, developers, designers, etc. — anyone with the passion to make their city better.
