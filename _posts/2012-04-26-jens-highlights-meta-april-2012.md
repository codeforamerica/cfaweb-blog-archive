“Work like you live in the early days of a better nation.” &#8211; Dennis Leigh

My current obsession (other than reading the applications to our new CfA Accelerator) is figuring out how to paint this quote on the most visible wall in our office, 10 feet tall by six feet wide. Through someone’s tweet (wish I could remember whose), I landed on a <a href="http://www.heraldscotland.com/work-as-if-you-live-in-the-early-days-of-a-better-nation-1.827519" target="_blank">2007 essay</a> by Scottish writer Alasdair Gray, who has apparently used this quote often in his work. It was one of those moments that refresh your appreciation of metaphor, as it seemed to literally jump out at me, to almost physically capture me. It’s quite a line, and quite a piece of advice.

I wasn’t always this sentimental, proverb-happy, or optimistic. Blame the CfA fellows, and everyone who supports them, for turning me into a sap. I guess what I like about the quote (and _like_ is a completely insufficient word here, of course) is that the Fellows are doing just that (and _doing_, as opposed to just thinking or talking, is a very important word here).

But we’re not living in the early days of a better nation, are we? Our country is more like Elvis shortly before he was found dead on his bathroom floor. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/22/opinion/sunday/friedman-down-with-everything.html?_r=1&src=me&ref=general" target="_blank">Thomas Friedman</a> called it as he sees it in his column in the New York Times this weekend, asking if America has “ gone from a democracy to a “vetocracy” — from a system designed to prevent anyone in government from amassing too much power to a system in which no one can aggregate enough power to make any important decisions at all?” He ends with the sobering note that if we can’t actually change institutional rules on major scale, “Then we will never be a great country again, no matter who is elected.”

I can’t bring myself to disagree with Friedman, or with any of the many other luminaries foretelling our doom as a nation. The picture is undoubtedly bleak. But if we’re coming to the end of something, we’re also by definition at the beginning of something else, and those who look for the clear line between the two will be disappointed. They’ll also miss the chance to shape what’s to come. The future won’t come in the form of proposals, suggestions, or political platforms. It will appear already functional, if marginalized. It will be actual and surprising, like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntwqVDzdqAU" target="_blank">Better Block’s pop up downtowns</a>, the success of <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a>, or interfaces to government that are <a href="http://discoverbps.org/" target="_blank">simple, beautiful and easy to us</a>e.

I can’t look at the hundreds of people applying to the Code for America <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/fellows" target="_blank">Fellowship</a>, the thousands lending hands through the <a href="http://brigade.codeforamerica.org" target="_blank">Brigade</a>, and the dozens of civic startups raising their hands for the <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/accelerator" target="_blank">Accelerator</a> and not see some sort of beginning. We’re in the early days of _something_, that’s for sure.
