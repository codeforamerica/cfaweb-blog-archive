Every year amazing people from across the U.S. apply for the <a title="Code for America Fellowship" href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/about/fellowship/" target="_blank">Code for America Fellowship</a>. The candidates, who come from startups, advocacy groups, government, and small and large tech companies have many options for where to spend their time and share their skills. We’re incredibly grateful that they choose to help make government work for the people, by the people, in the 21st century.

The range of applicants each year is no accident. We believe that a working democracy needs to work for everyone. Over the past five years, in line with <a title="Code for America Values" href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/about/values/" target="_blank">CfA’s organizational values</a>, we’ve worked hard on our recruiting process so that the candidates, and the resulting Fellowship class, reflect the communities we serve.

We’re proud of the talented Fellows we recruit year after year, but also realize we have room to improve.

Below is an overview of Code for America’s recruiting data. After taking a look, we hope you’ll take a minute to suggest organizations and communities you think we should be in touch with about the Fellowship (<a title="Code for America - 2015 Fellowship Recruitment Input" href="http://bit.ly/cfa_recruitment" target="_blank">here’s the 1-minute form</a>).

**Recruitment Data**
  
Much like we <a title="Code for America - 2014 Fellowship Applicants" href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/blog/2013/08/01/2014_fellows_applications/" target="_blank">documented last year</a>, this is a breakdown of our Fellowship applicants by different skill set and demographic data points (we’ll be announcing the 2015 class names and data points after the conclusion of the 2014 Fellowship in November).

As an organization committed to making change within the civic space and the communities served by our governments, we share these data points as a way to create transparency and to challenge ourselves to keep thinking of ways to broaden our reach in sharing the Fellowship.

We look forward to officially announcing the 2015 Fellows in November! And again, please help us keep improving our reach to diverse, talented technologists and government geeks by <a title="Code for America - 2015 Fellowship Recruitment Input" href="http://bit.ly/cfa_recruitment" target="_blank">filling out this 1-minute form</a>.
