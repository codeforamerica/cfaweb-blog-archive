Earlier this month, after our fellows returned from their city residency, we hosted an &#8220;Inception&#8221; for each of our projects. In the day-long brainstorming session in collaboration with our city partners, we went from product pitches to feature sets &#8212; thanks to the fantastic facilitation from Pivotal Labs. Seattle&#8217;s CIO [Bill Schrier](http://schrier.wordpress.com) was in attendance and recently posted a [great summary](http://schrier.wordpress.com/2011/03/25/the-inception-event-cfa/) of the day and overview of the process, excerpted below.

    Code for America’s premise is simple – citizens and governments face the fundamentally the same issues whether they live in South Beach on Staten Island or San Antonio or Seattle. Sometimes we can create online applications to help solve those problems. And if we create them – and we make those applications open source – cities across the United States – perhaps even the world – can take those open source solutions and use them.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Code for America hires “fellows” – usually recent college grads or others with real world experience and a lot of tech savvy – to analyze these problems and write these apps.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This does require money, of course. The City of Seattle (the department I lead – DoIT) pitched in some dollars. But I’m very grateful to Microsoft via Joanne Harrell for contributing $50,000, and to Jack Dangermond of ESRI for chipping in an additional $50,000. Joanne and Microsoft, Jack and ESRI see the potential of this amazing model.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Seattle, Philadelphia and Boston are the launch cities for this ambitious concept. I’ve previously blogged about what I hoped to get from our Code for America project – see my blog about Citywatch.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In February, the CfA fellows came to our three cities and spent a lot of time with those people I mentioned above – the civic leaders who have “figured out the secret sauce” to getting things done in their neighborhoods – but also the City staff often stymied as well. They heard about the problems with trying to take action – that civic leaders can’t find each other and have difficulty getting their message out to like-minded activists. And they heard about the difficulty in finding those meetings of neighborhood blockwatches and community councils and precinct advisory boards – the “meet ups” for neighborhood leaders.

    Cue the Code for America “inception event” on March 17th.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This was an amazing eight hours.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    First, all the fellows assigned to Seattle, Philly and Boston got together with Code for America staff and our Cities technology folks, including me. The fellows had already brainstormed several potential applications to solve our community activism problems.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Dan Melton, CfA’s Chief Technology Officer, took the whole group through an exercise to develop the concepts for four potential apps, and determine our overall level of interest in them. People stood on their feet throughout this exercise. If we were wildly enthusiastic about an idea, we stood to the far right of the room. If we were “meh” (ambivalent) about it, we stood at the left side.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Then Dan asked us why we were enthusiastic – or not. In the process, we also further developed the ideas – added functions or features or discarded them.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Next, we voted on the ideas and came up with the top two.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In the afternoon, we went through a deeper dive to develop each application further. This reminded me a lot of doing a work breakdown structure for a project. We looked at potential users of the application (our civic leaders) and what they would find useful. We considered which features would be essential for the first version, and which ones could wait until later versions. We talked a little about what apps presently perform the function, because we don’t want to re-invent an app which already exists.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I worked on the “engagement toolkit” project. As we developed it, it turned into a simple web-based application which a neighborhood activist could use to describe their particular issue or passion. It would include a “splash page” which simply describes the issue or idea. But it could also include flyers or doorhangers to solicit others to the “cause”. It might include e-mail list capability or an online map describing the issue. And it could include simple project management tools – checklists or timelines – to help move the issue forward.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Most importantly, the engagement toolkit would allow neighborhood activists to mobilize their friends and neighbors to the cause. Working together, they might solve certain problems without any help from their city or county government. They might also be able to find similar groups across a city – or even across the nation – who have already solved their particular problem, and adapt the same solution.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Over the next few months the Code for America staff and fellows will develop this concept into an online application. They’ll test it out with the civic leaders they’ve already identified in Seattle and Philly. And in August or September we’ll roll it out and starting using it.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    With a little luck, we can marry the “inception event” at Code for America, combined with “inception events” which create budding civic leaders, to create new, online, tools to improve our blocks, our neighborhoods, our communities, and our America as a nation.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    From the ground … up.
