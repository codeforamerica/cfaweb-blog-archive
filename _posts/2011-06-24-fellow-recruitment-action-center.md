[<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7045" title="fellow-recruitment" src="http://codeforamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/fellow-recruitment.jpg" alt="" />](http://codeforamerica.org/fellows/spread-the-word)We&#8217;re actively recruiting for our 2012 fellowship, and we need developers, designers, and entrepreneurs eager to make a difference and ready to step up to make government for open and efficient. We know there&#8217;s lots of talent waiting to get involved all across the country, and we need you to help us find them. 

You can do something as simple as a tweet or as fun as a party — we’ve even put together [some tools](http://codeforamerica.org/spread-the-word) to make it easy for you to make some noise, get some local support, tap your friends, and even bring people together.

Check out our [fellow recruitment action center](http://codeforamerica.org/recruit): <http://codeforamerica.org/recruit>

One big thing you can do is host an event bringing together people in the community to talk about open government or even hack on it. We threw together some tips and advice to help you out.
