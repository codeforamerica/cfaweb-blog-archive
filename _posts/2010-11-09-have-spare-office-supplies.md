Code for America is agonizingly close to confirming our office space for 2011. Regardless of the location, however, there are some things we know we&#8217;ll need toget up and running in the space, and we also know that we won&#8217;t have much time or resources to make that happen. 20 fellows are coming on board in under two months. That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re asking for your help. If you or your company has any office supplies on hand and are looking to help a worthy cause, please consider donating to Code for America. A starter list of what we&#8217;ll need is below, but if there&#8217;s something you have you think we could use &#8212; a ping pong table? an old Atari? &#8212; don&#8217;t hesitate to let us know.<!--more-->

  * **Office chairs.** We have [20 Fellows](http://codeforamerica.org/2010/11/01/2011-cfa-fellows) coming on board, and 6 staff members. Ideally, we&#8217;d like 26 of the same type of comfortable chairs&#8230; we&#8217;ll be working long hours!
  * **Monitors, keyboards, and power cords.** With a dynamic space and a month of traveling,we&#8217;re expecting everyone will be carrying around their laptops, but it&#8217;d be good to have a way for everyone to sit down with a monitor and keyboard and get some work done. If you have lots, a couple, or even just one to spare, do let us know; we&#8217;d love to have 26 sets.
  * **LCD Projector, Screen.** Education is a big part of our Fellowship program. We&#8217;ll be bringing in technology and government leaders to speak and present to our Fellows throughout the year. If you have either an LCD Projector or screen (or both!) contact us.
  * **Copier, scanner:** it can be an all-in-one, or two discreet machines.
  * **Couches, lounge chairs.** We&#8217;ll have a welcome area, as well as a lounge in either of the spaces we&#8217;re considering. We can mix and match, so if you have any spare couches or lounge chairs please let us know.
  * **Desk phones, speaker phones.** We&#8217;ll have a conference room and will require one high-quality speaker phone; we also will need 10-12 desk phones.
  * **Cafe tables and chairs.** We&#8217;ll need some number of tables and chairs in our kitchen area or lounge; matching would be nice but if you have any please let us know.
  * **Bean bag chairs.** Why not, everyone loves bean bag chairs!

Please contact us at info@codeforamerica.org if you think you might be able to help us get our space well outfitted in 2011. If you can send a picture along with your email, that would be great. We&#8217;re hoping to be in our space by December 1, 2010, so we&#8217;ll be able to begin accepting donations at that point. Thanks so much!
