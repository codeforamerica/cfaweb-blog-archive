Though we are known as a fellowship program, Code for America is really at its heart a network. Since the fellows are here for only a year, the relationships they form with partners in their cities and with each other are assets they carry into their next careers, but literally hundreds of other people in all kinds of industries and positions help support and connect the people in this organization. One group I’d like to thank in particular is the mentors. Each fellow identifies their own goals for mentorship, which can include feedback on their work at Code for America, ongoing career guidance, connections to government and industry, or any other goal they want to pursue. Fellows and mentors meet periodically throughout the year and hopefully afterwards as well. I’d like to thank the following people for being so generous of their time and expertise this year:

  * Ben Berkowitz, SeeClickFix
  * Bryce Roberts, OATV
  * Carl Tashian, OurGoods
  * Danese Cooper, Wikimedia
  * Denise Gershbein, Frog
  * DJ Patil, Greylock
  * Emily Chang, IdeaCodes
  * Heather Champ, Fertile Medium
  * Hilary Hoeber, Ideo
  * Jay Nath, City of San Francisco
  * Joe Edelman, Groundcrew
  * John Lilly, Greylock
  * Manish Shah, Rap Leaf
  * Michal Migurski, Stamen Design
  * Parker Thompson, Pivotal Labs
  * Steven Spiker, Urban Strategies Council
  * Stewart Brand, The Long Now Foundation
  * Tim O&#8217;Reilly, O&#8217;Reilly Media
  * Tom Preston-Werner, Github

In addition, a truly huge shout out to Wendy Owen and Ron Bouganim for mentoring the Pheattle and Boston teams, respectively. To all our mentors, thank you!
