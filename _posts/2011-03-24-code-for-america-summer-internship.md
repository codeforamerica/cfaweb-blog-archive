Have the summer off and looking to make a difference? Code for America is now recruiting summer interns with the skills to take on big problems in a short timeline. Trust us, this isn’t your typical internship. You’ll have a core project which you’ll lead with autonomy, creative freedom, and responsibility. Lots of it. Plus, you’ll get to work with a small, passionate, and experienced team that’ll rely on you to have an impact. By the end of the summer, you’ll walk away with not only a new network of industry and civic leaders, but also with a finished product to point to and say, “I did that.”

The unpaid summer internship will feature an open government primer modeled off of our [CfA Training](http://codeforamerica.org/the-2011-cfa-institute/), as well as ongoing mentorship from our [fellows](http://codeforamerica.org/2011-fellows/), [staff](http://codeforamerica.org/about), and [board](http://codeforamerica.org/who-we-are). Working out of our San Francisco office, each intern will be given a project to focus on from their preferred track &#8212; code, design, or policy. **Find more information [here](http://codeforamerica.org/intern) and [apply now below](#app).** The deadline for applications is April 15.

  * Apps for Education. What apps would you build to get high school students more engaged in their education?
  * New Tools for a New Model. CfA is part incubator, part volunteer corps, so we need custom collaboration tools.

  * Redesign.Gov. Find a government website most in need of a redesign, and then make it look beautiful.
  * Civic Branding Guide. CfA will take on dozens of projects this year; how should they look and feel?

  * Civic Startups. New reseach is necessary on the business models and potential roadblocks for Gov 2.0 companies. 
  * Open Source Procurement. Governments are increasingly developing reusable code, but why aren’t they sharing?

_Note: The internship is unpaid, and interns will need to work out of San Francisco for the duration of the program. International candidates with the necessary paperwork to intern over the summer are welcome to apply, however, Code for America cannot sponsor work visas at this time._
