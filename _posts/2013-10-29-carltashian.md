_This post is part of an ongoing series by Code for America mentors. Carl Tashian is a 2013 mentor at Code for America, and has mentored startups in the 2012 and 2013 programs. _

I’ve always found it hard when I’m in the thick of things to stop and consider what I’ve learned. I could make a cold business case that, as a startup founder, I should avoid doing anything that isn’t mission-critical for the company. Just work, sleep, and get some exercise in between. I shouldn’t be writing this blog post. I shouldn’t take time to mentor. Not now.

Thankfully, to preserve my sanity, I choose not to live that way. I began mentoring at Code for America three years ago. I love helping others with their dreams, and being part of a supportive community. I love the people I’ve met and worked with along the way. There is such great talent in the room, and the desire to solve big problems, and it’s infectious. Whenever I get a chance to visit Code for America&#8217;s headquarters, it is a highlight of my week.

Mentoring encourages me to reflect on my experiences and to try to distill some useful insights. It helps me better understand what we’re trying to accomplish at my current startup, [yerdle](https://www.yerdle.com/). There is a kind of magic, when things are going well, where it appears as though a team people is building something way beyond the sum of their parts. It’s amazing! But how does one learn to build such an environment?

In Silicon Valley, I think the answer is in the folklore. I say “folklore” because we are all trying to understand how to unlock the magic, and it is an evolving dialogue that happens primarily through word-of-mouth. People try to codify the folklore into folk religion, and by now there are many versions of &#8220;The One Book Your Startup Will Ever Need&#8221; out there. While those books can be super helpful, they aren’t enough. We need the folklore.

The folklore is where we really assimilate the lessons–with our peers, over coffee and at whiteboards. Where the magic really happens is where we&#8217;re working together in real-time on a compelling problem. Sharing experiences, celebrating and commiserating &#8212; it’s a two-way street. Inevitably, startups that are struggling in areas where I can help are also breezing through challenges that have eluded my team.

This startup folklore extends around the globe, but it is palpable around the cafes, parks and makeshift startup offices of San Francisco. Everyone benefits, and I believe it is everyone’s responsibility to contribute.

That’s why I’m here. For the folklore, for the kinship and for the love.
