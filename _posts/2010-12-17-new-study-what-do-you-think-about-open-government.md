[Socrata](http://www.socrata.com/) released this week its [Open Government Data Benchmark Survey](http://benchmarkstudy.socrata.com/), which was worthwhile not just for the questions that it asked, but also its approach. Instead of just focusing on just government officials or developers, the study polled both, as well as the public more broadly. The result was an interesting, useful, broad, and yet detailed picture of the effort to open up government.

We&#8217;re pleased to have partnered for the development of the survey, in collaboration with the Sunlight Foundation, the Personal Democracy Forum, GovLoop, and David Eaves. The full report is available [online](http://www.socrata.com/benchmark-study/), as [pdf](http://www.socrata.com/benchmark-study/download-report/), and (of course) in Socrata&#8217;s data management software. A few key findings caught our attention.<!--more-->

**Why Code for America?
  
** 
  
The survey asked developers to identify their motivation for developing civic applications. We were happy to see their findings matched what we found [in our fellowship applications](http://codeforamerica.org/2010/08/11/why-apply-see-for-yourself/). They want to code things that matter. 43.6 percent of developers cite the potential for their applications to impact people&#8217;s daily lives as their primary motivator.

The study also found strong support for the role of outside developers in government movement, as well: 61.4 percent of citizens and 88.3 percent of government stakeholders believe that developers and entrepreneurs will transform government data assets into useful applications and services.

**Obstacles and Challenges
  
** 
  
That said, the picture wasn&#8217;t entirely bright. The study found that governments at all levels felt there were significant obstacles to transparency.

When compared to other levels of governments, cities&#8217; issues with &#8220;technical resource availability&#8221; stood out, which aligns with what [we have been finding](http://codeforamerica.org/2010/09/10/many-birds-with-one-stone/). Across the board, the most common roadblocks were financial challenges, privacy and security concerns, and a &#8220;lack of political will or leadership.&#8221;

Fortunately, from what we are seeing inside our cities, from our fellows, and even in this survey &#8212; voters support 3-to-1 Open Gov candidates &#8212; the political winds are changing, but it won&#8217;t be easy. Let&#8217;s keep [working.](http://codeforamerica.org/cities/citizen-action-center)
