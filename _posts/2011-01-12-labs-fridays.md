**Space to Learn and Create Something New**
  
Innovation happens when we learn new concepts, ideas, coding techniques, and recombine those skills to solve interesting problems. Labs Fridays is an opportunity to explore and test new without pressure of failure. Setting aside 20% time on a specific day creates space to explore, form new teams and try something different. Projects from Labs Fridays can feed your city&#8217;s pipeline for new and interesting IT or business process projects.

**Connect City Staff with Citizen Technologists**
   
Labs Fridays is a great way to connect local developers, designers and other technologists with city staff. City staff can learn new technologies and teach developers how to interact with their city. 

**Set up Your Own Labs Friday**
  
Find a space big enough for your group (50 to 100), grab a projector, and start the day with a few great 1 hour seminars (i.e. learn Git in ten minutes or CouchDB for geeks). Following the workshop topics, set aside 30ish minutes for people to &#8216;pitch&#8217; for a minute on a project. After that, people vote with their feet, gravitating to a project. Ask the project manager to share a blurb on Monday morning, and promote the projects! That&#8217;s it.
