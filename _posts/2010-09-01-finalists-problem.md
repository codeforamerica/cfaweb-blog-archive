**_Deadline: September 13_**

As a finalist, you&#8217;ve already demonstrated great experience, passion, or drive. We want to see how you attack a problem. You can respond in whatever format best shows off your skill set: you can provide us with a code snippet, essay, design, wireframes, workflow chart, comic book, storyboard, charts and graphs, etc &#8212; whatever will give us the best sense of your thinking, creativity, and skills.

**Please review the problem statement below and respond by September 13 to <info@codeforamerica.org>.**

**Problem Statement
  
** The City of Boston is rolling out a universal ID card to every high school student to keep track of attendance, library use, participation in after-school community groups and organizations, and public transit. Boston&#8217;s goals in this effort are:

  * To keep students in school and improve their attendance records;
  * To get students using the wide variety of resources in their communities to enhance their education, and to see that education is a process that extends beyond the walls of their school;
  * To collect and understand data about the effectiveness of various programs that the City funds (after school and community group programs, for example, which will use the ID card system);
  * To improve the overall effectiveness of community&#8217;s education system.

What would you do with this data to achieve one or more of Boston&#8217;s goals?

Be sure to state whatever assumptions you make in crafting your response, and while we realize privacy issues are relevant, don&#8217;t let those concerns limit your thinking too much &#8212; just keep them in mind.

**Response is mandatory and due by September 13 to<info@codeforamerica.org>.**
