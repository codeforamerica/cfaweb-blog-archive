I created my GitHub account last year during my first week &#8211; perhaps day &#8211; as a 2012 Code for America fellow. I had to do this in order to complete a challenge that would earn me the coveted CfA track jacket. It&#8217;s been over a year now and I push to GitHub daily.

In what could be a long post of its own, GitHub and open source &#8211; the tool and community &#8211; I didn&#8217;t know existed before Code for America, were those things I couldn&#8217;t quite put my finger on that were desperately needed in government technology (where I worked prior to the fellowship). There was no turning back for me. It&#8217;s been this tool and community that has given my work more purpose and filled my calendar with events and a whole new set of friends in a state I&#8217;d never been to before packing up and moving cross-country for CfA.

Before I wax poetic anymore, I&#8217;ll cut to the chase. I&#8217;m currently at <a title="DIY" href="http://www.diy.org" target="_blank">DIY.org</a> &#8211; an amazing group of people who have created a network of kid-makers. These makers complete challenges to earn skills and share with each other how the process went &#8211; you know, being all open source about it. I&#8217;m at DIY to build out a suite of skills in the &#8220;hacker&#8221; category. We&#8217;ve retooled the <a title="DIY n00b Skill" href="http://www.diy.org/skills/n00b" target="_blank">n00b</a> skill and launched <a title="DIY Web Designer Skill" href="http://www.diy.org/skills/webdesigner" target="_blank">Web Designer</a> and most recently we&#8217;ve launched <a title="DIY Open Sourcerer Skill" href="http://www.diy.org/skills/opensourcerer" target="_blank">Open Sourcerer</a>.

The backbone and goal of the challenges in Open Sourcerer is to have each maker fork a copy of a <a title="DIY Open Sourcerer Repo on GitHub" href="http://www.github.com/diy/open-sourcerer" target="_blank">repo on DIY&#8217;s Github</a> with a story in it. They&#8217;ll each add a part to the story, push it back to their fork and submit a pull request to add it to the DIY original. There is no coding involved &#8211; just pure collaboration and learning the basics of <a title="Git" href="http://www.git-scm.com" target="_blank">Git</a> and <a title="GitHub" href="http://www.github.com" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.

Returning to the not-so-long-ago time that I learned these things, I created a companion guide for this skill. The <a title="Open Sourcerer Guide" href="http://opensourcerer.diy.org" target="_blank">Open Sourcerer Guide</a> walks through each of the challenges, which happen to also be the basic elements of contributing to open source on GitHub. While the site is aimed a younger audience, the guide works for everyÂ beginner.

So all ye who have thought about open source but haven&#8217;t made the leap or were wary of Terminal, take the first step! And to all ye who push in your sleep (or don&#8217;t sleep because you push) have a look at the guide (and its <a title="Open Sourcerer Guide Repo" href="http://www.github.com/diy/opensourcerer.diy.org" target="_blank">repo</a>), send issues or pull requests to help improve it!
