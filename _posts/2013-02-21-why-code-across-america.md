This weekend, in 22 communities throughout country, hundreds of passionate citizens are coming together to <a href="http://brigade.codeforamerica.org/pages/codeacross" target="_blank">Code Across America</a>.

> &#8220;I&#8217;m coding for America because I want to radically alter the relationship between citizens and government.&#8221;
  
> _&#8211; Lt. Governor Gavin Newsom_

> &#8220;I code for America because I want innovation to be synonymous with city hall&#8221;
