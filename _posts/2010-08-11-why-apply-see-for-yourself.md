With only a **few days left to apply** for the [Code for America fellowship](http://codeforamerica.org/fellows), we are starting to review the applications we have received. While we&#8217;ve been impressed by the candidates&#8217; credentials and experiences, what stands out the most are their responses to the basic prompt: &#8220;Why do you want to participate in Code for America?&#8221; We decided to pipe them into the [Wordle.net](http://wordle.net) word cloud generator, so you can take a look for yourself:

</p>

This says to us that people &#8220;believe&#8221; in &#8220;government,&#8221; &#8220;technology,&#8221; and &#8220;people,&#8221; and that they &#8220;want&#8221; to &#8220;make&#8221; something. That&#8217;s exactly what we&#8217;re looking for. If feel the same way, we encourage you to [apply to join them](http://codeforamerica.org/apply): <http://codeforamerica.org/apply>. 

We promise, you&#8217;ll be in good company.
