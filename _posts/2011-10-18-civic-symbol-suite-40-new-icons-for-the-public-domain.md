In late June, prompted by an idea from fellow Chach Sikes, Matt Lewis wrote a stirring love letter titled, **&#8220;Code for America loves you!&#8221;** This was directed to [Noun Project](http://thenounproject.com/ "The Noun Project"), an online repository of public domain icons, because just about every application we built relied on their symbols and icons to help make navigation more intuitive, and we weren&#8217;t the only ones. But we also realized that there is a host of civic developers and designers who would benefit from a larger civic symbol set. So after a few phone calls and emails, we were hosting our first collaborative design event &#8212; an &#8220;[Iconathon](http://iconathon.org)&#8221; &#8212; which quickly spread across the country. Suddenly, together with the Noun Project, we were remotely planning events in six difference cities, creating symbols and iconography for a wide rage of civic topics including; 311, Food and Nutrition, Community, Democracy, Education and Transportation. Hundreds of people turned out, and dozens of designs were made &#8212; all in just a few weeks.

The result, launching today, is this: a [Civic Symbol Suite](http://thenounproject.com/organization/iconathon/ "Civic Symbol Suite"), a democratically created icon set for use in the public domain: 

[<img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-9439" title="civicsymbolsuite" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6173/6256613916_4fcdde0810_o.jpg" alt="" />](http://codeforamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/civicsymbolsuite.png)

We had hundreds of passionate volunteers from all over the country, help design and refine the symbols. These symbols are as much about the unified aesthetic as they are about the the positive social impact they could have. Our hope is simple, to help build this universal visual language &#8212; a language which anyone can use, developer, designer, policymaker or ordinary citizen, to communicate more effectively and yes, more beautifully with their communities. We hope that these symbols can help break down some of the communication barriers that exist on a national level. And to [quote the Noun Project](http://blog.thenounproject.com/post/11614433087/iconathon-symbol-suite-is-here):

> &#8220;By placing these symbols into the public domain we hope they can be put to good use in your community and make a positive impact.  We hope teachers and schools can use the bully symbol to educate their students about the damaging and lasting effects of bullying.  We hope the food bank symbol can help guide the hungry and less fortunate to a nutritious meal.  We hope the peaceful protest symbol can be used by protestors around the world trying to fight for change and a better life. Most of all though we hope these symbols can be used as an example of what can happen when you bring together volunteers who are passionate about their community.&#8221; 

You can find all of the [40 civic icons on the Noun Project](http://thenounproject.com/organization/iconathon/) as ready-to-go vector files. We hope that these icons trickle their way into mobile and web apps, making easier for designers and developers give back and also help jump start civic design process. 

And finally to everyone who participated in our events, either by attending and submitting designs or just spreading the word, thank you&#8230; Thank you for helping us start this movement.
