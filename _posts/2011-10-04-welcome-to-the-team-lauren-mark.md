Today, I&#8217;m pleased to introduce a few new members of our team, Lauren Reid and Mark Pan.

She hosts a solid background in non-profit communications and has worked on various local and national campaigns blending new and traditional mediums. Lauren spent the past several years amplifying the voice of registered nurses as a member of the California Nurses Association (CNA) communications team. Before that, Lauren served in the art department of San Francisco magazine and facilitated communications at ACLU of Northern California. Lauren, often found Canon in-hand, is a self-proclaimed documentarian of democracy. In sum, she gets our mission, shares our passion, and has talent in marketing, writing, and design. Expect to hear a lot from her &#8212; I for one am looking forward to it.

He just received a degree in urban studies and education from the University of Pennsylvania. As an undergraduate, Mark led a host of web and tech initiatives as the student body vice president, taught hip hop dance, dabbled in web design, and mixed music for various groups. After interning at Code for America, Mark will be teaching in Malaysia on a Fulbright fellowship and then in Hawai&#8217;i with, who else, Teach for America. He&#8217;s already made a huge impact in the office, and we&#8217;re excited to have his energy, resourcefulness, and help. (I&#8217;m somewhat inclined to steal his passport, so he can&#8217;t leave &#8212; just don&#8217;t tell him.) In any event, we&#8217;re lucky to have him.

Please join me in welcoming to the team, Lauren and Mark!
