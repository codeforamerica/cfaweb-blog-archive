With just over a year having passed since the <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/2012/11/02/mapping-floods/" target="_blank">humble beginning of ATXfloods</a> in Austin, Texas it&#8217;s a good time to check back in with the team in Austin and see how it&#8217;s been going.

<p dir="ltr">
  <a href="http://www.atxfloods.com/index.php" target="_blank">ATXfloods</a> is an interactive map of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_water_crossing" target="_blank">low water crossings</a> in Austin, updated via Twitter and Google Docs integration. People use it to figure out which routes to take in heavy rain. Initially, it was created by Matt Porcher of Austin&#8217;s Watershed department and me — in less than a month. Since the initial soft-launch I haven’t contributed any code or in any  other way, aside from talking to a few reporters and tweeting a couple times. So when I talk about what amazes me about this project I want to be clear: I am not talking about my success, but Austin&#8217;s.

  I recently caught up with Matt and asked him a few questions, and thought it worth highlighting a few aspects that continue to set this project apart.
</p>

#### ATXfloods is a web app that is maintained, hosted, and is being actively worked on by Austin’s Watershed Department.

As they continue to enhance it, picking up a few necessary skills along the way they&#8217;ve built their team to working on it. According to Matt, they&#8217;ve made two important hires relating to ATXfloods: Tomas Rodriguez, “a civil engineer with a background in graphic and web design to be part of the Flood Early Warning System (FEWS) team. Tomas re-built parts of the site using JQuery and Google Maps to fix incompatibilities with the City’s network. He also built a great [mobile version](http://www.atxfloods.com/mobile.html), optimized for smartphones and tablets.”

They also hired an engineering student from University of Texas named <a href="https://twitter.com/stevelyons" target="_blank">Steve Lyons</a> “to create a ‘dashboard’ admin interface to ATXfloods.”

<p dir="ltr">
  When asked what they’ve learned this past year, working on ATXfloods, Matt says &#8220;Simple and easy to use is better than feature-rich and difficult to use.&#8221;
</p>

#### It has become the best local, up-to-date information source for media, citizens, and city employees to refer to in emergencies.

[<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-27875" alt="photo" src="http://www.codeforamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/photo-300x224.jpg" />](http://www.codeforamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/photo.jpg)

Matt explains “most traffic comes from links on local broadcast and print media websites. The City has worked to promote the website to local media and also introduced the hashtag #atxfloods, which is now commonly used during flood events.”

“We’ve seen ATXfloods live on TV to show flooded roads to the public. The media has been great about publicizing our website. In fact, we’ve heard from the public information officer that media calls during storms have significantly dropped off because the press is going straight to ATXfloods to find out the latest information.”

#### Austin had their <a href="http://www.statesman.com/news/news/breaking-news/officials-say-17-homes-uninhabitable-after-travis-/nbfgy/" target="_blank">worst flood in 30 years</a>, and people turned to ATXfloods for information.

<p dir="ltr">
  Matt says “Including the day before and after the flood, we had more than 40,000 unique visitors to the site, which is more than we’ve ever had.”
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  “Four people lost their lives and more than 600 houses flooded. ATXfloods featured every low water crossing closure as they happened (more than 40). As the storm escalated from a nuisance-type flood with closed low water crossings to a life-threatening flash flood where people were getting water in their homes, the “banner” message at the top of the site had the latest information available. The <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0Arv5_dcOmot9dFMwZlotbTZBakx3SzJha1Juc0VtLVE&output=html">Google spreadsheet</a>, acted as an event log of everything that was happening.”

#### Lastly, ATXfloods is scaling beyond Austin.

<p dir="ltr">
  In the last few days, Matt sent me an email that said &#8220;We launched the 2.0 version, which has the admin dashboard with multiple user support. It looks basically the same &#8230; but it will allow us to create accounts for other nearby jurisdictions to manage the updating of their flooded roads.&#8221;
