Every summer, Google devotes significant resources &#8212; time, money, and effort &#8212; into creating opportunities for students across the world to get involved in open source projects. The projects aren’t even their own; they are from hundreds of organizations whose main commonality is their commitment to developing great, shareable, and reusable software. Code for America is honored to be selected to join them this year as a [Google Summer of Code](http://www.google-melange.com/) [Mentoring Organization](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/accepted_orgs/google/gsoc2011). We’re excited to have the opportunity to engage with bright, talented coders and spend the summer working with them to build innovative civic software. 

For students interested in participating in one of our projects, please find out more information about our [GSoC program and **apply with Google**](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/org/google/gsoc2011/codeforamerica). And you can learn more about our proposed summer projects right here: <http://codeforamerica.org/projects>
