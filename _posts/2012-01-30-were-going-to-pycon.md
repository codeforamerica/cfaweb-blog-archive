[PyCon](https://us.pycon.org/2012/) is the largest annual gathering for the [<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-11007" title="pycon_logo" src="http://codeforamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/pycon_logo-300x109.gif" alt="" />](http://codeforamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/pycon_logo.gif)
  
community using the Python programming language. The conference has been growing in size tremendously over the past couple years (this year will feature [more than 90 talks and 30 tutorials](http://pycon.blogspot.com/2012/01/pycon-2012-news-tutorials-talks-and.html)).

Today, Code for America is happy to announce we&#8217;ll be one of the F/OSS sponsors â€” meaning we&#8217;ll be partnering with PyCon in helping spread information on our values, the use of open-source technologies, and Python. We&#8217;re incredibly excited to go!
