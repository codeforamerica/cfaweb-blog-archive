Last night, [Github](http://www.github.com) held a thank you [party](https://github.com/blog/952-1-million-user-party-mon-oct-17-in-sf) to celebrate a huge milestone, [1 million users](https://github.com/blog/936-one-million). To put that in perspective, the Bureau of Labor Statistics [reports](http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos303.htm) that the US employs around 1.3 million software developers. Even factoring in international and non-coders, they&#8217;ve got a serious percentage of the talent market.

Reaching 1 million users for any startup is awesome. Reaching 1 million software developers as users is a sublime network effect. For me, Github is not just a code repository. It&#8217;s a discovery system for brilliant people to find and leverage each other&#8217;s work product to innovate and hone their craft.

We find and follow all kinds of interesting gov 2.0 coders through forks, watching, issues and just googling &#8216;\____  github.&#8217; It&#8217;s a talent pool meets project management system meets science show off lab.

Github powers almost everything we do for code at Code for America. All of our [documentation](http://www.github.com/codeforamerica), projects, templates, [cultural elements](https://github.com/codeforamerica/cfa_coder_sounds), [daily](http://commits.codeforamerica.org) and [Last night, [Github](http://www.github.com) held a thank you [party](https://github.com/blog/952-1-million-user-party-mon-oct-17-in-sf) to celebrate a huge milestone, [1 million users](https://github.com/blog/936-one-million).

Beyond CfA, nearly every open government project, app contest entry, hack weekend or other major multi-person coding effort is happening free and open through GitHub.

I think it&#8217;s quickly becoming an underpinning piece of infrastructure in the open government movement.

Github, thanks for playing a part in hosting the open government movement.

Our Badgers & Pandas salute your OctoCats.
