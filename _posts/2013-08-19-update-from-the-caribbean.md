Because of the volatility associated with dependence on food imports, Caribbean officials have made it an imperative to invest in local food production, promoting the rise of farmers and agriculture on the islands themselves.

I was interested to read about this movement because our [Code for the Caribbean](http://codeforthecaribbean.org) partners are working on just these issues in their pilot program with the Rural Agriculture Development Agency (RADA) of Jamaica. The Fellows—Rory, Varun, and Staysean—kicked off their work at the beginning of July but the foundation has been laid over the past several months by Matthew McNaughton and his [SlashRoots](http://slashroots.org) team in partnership with the [Caribbean Open Institute](http://caribbeanopeninstitute.org). Last week I traveled to Kingston to see how they are progressing.

The problem that the fellows have been assigned to tackle is that of praedial larceny—the theft of crops and livestock from farmers’ fields—which costs farmers in the Caribbean tens of millions of dollars a year. As the _New York Times_ article notes, praedial larceny is one of the main reasons Jamaicans abandon farming. If they can better manage this problem they can increase the amount of agriculture production done on the island and create stability around the price of food.

Using praedial larceny as the concrete issue around which they can organize, the CftC fellows are also working to build capacity within RADA to manage data about farmers and provide better services to those farmers while working within constrained budgets. Many farmers haven’t seen their extension officer—the RADA official assigned to be the point of contact for farmers in a certain region—in years which drives up mistrust amongst the farmers.

Five weeks in, they are deep in the problem discovery process. The first two weeks of the program were spent in orientation and training, followed by work in the field talking to farmers, community groups, police officers, agriculture officials, and program managers working in the IT department of the ministry. I find them back in the office buried in post-its (I know the feeling well). The yellow ones are observations, and they’re all tagged with a code that refers back to a record of an interview. The pink ones (the pile that’s growing the fastest) are open questions, like: What is the benefit of being a registered farmer? How many farmers are there in the country that aren’t registered? How often do farmers come into contact with their extension officer, and does the agriculture ministry have data on these contacts? Once they’ve fleshed these questions and observations out, they’ll schedule another round of interviews to reach clarity before they begin the design and prototyping process.

The culmination of all of this research will be a presentation to RADA officials outlining their conclusions so far and some preliminary recommendations for projects and products. After that, it’s a round of development sprints interspersed with user testing and iteration—all in collaboration with RADA officials. We’ll be continuing to update their progress here on the blog.
