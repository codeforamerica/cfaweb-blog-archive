[<img class=" wp-image-28398 alignright" alt="Reid Hoffman" src="http://www.codeforamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Reid-Hoffman-200x300.jpg" />](http://www.codeforamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Reid-Hoffman.jpg)Everything that Code for America Fellows, Brigades, local government partners, and startups do through these programs is made possible by our donors. From civic hackers who give their time along with an annual $25 gift, to the business and philanthropy leaders who make major grants, each has a vision for our country’s future and wants to see it become real.

Today we’re thrilled to announce that LinkedIn Co-founder and venture capitalist **Reid Hoffman** is joining the ranks of CfA supporters with a $250,000 matching grant — hoping to inspire others to put their end-of-year charitable contributions towards furthering CfA’s vision as well.

Jeff Weiner, LinkedIn&#8217;s CEO, has said that “Reid&#8217;s true north is making a positive and lasting impact on the world, in a very profound way.” Hoffman sees huge opportunities early; past investments in companies like Facebook and AirBnB, and board positions at non-profits Mozilla and Kiva attest to that. His support of Code for America is further recognition that just as the internet and mobile have changed business and society, now citizens are using technology to make government work in the 21st century. For those frustrated with government’s speed to adapt, Reid’s matching challenge offers a way to do something about it.

**Reid Hoffman on why he’s supporting Code for America:**

> “Code for America is bringing the promise of Silicon Valley to government. Their strategy is straight from the tech innovation playbook: building experimental solutions; scaling open-source projects; and nurturing startups that can transform a marketplace.
> 
> “I support Code for America because I want to live in a society where government is open and responsive, where public services are built with actual people in mind, and where I feel like my active participation is encouraged. CfA is making that vision a reality. I hope you’ll join me by giving whatever you can to Code for America today.”
