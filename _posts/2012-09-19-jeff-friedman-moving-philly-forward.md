[<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-16713" title="JeffFriedman" src="http://codeforamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/JeffFriedman.jpeg" alt="" />](http://codeforamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/JeffFriedman.jpeg)Jeff Friedman took the position as the manager of the Mayor’s Office of Civic Innovation and Participation for the City of Philadelphia when Mayor Nutter took office in April 2010.

And he came in with some strong marching orders.

“The mayor articulated a broad vision for openness in government when he came in,” Friedman said. “Part of the tone and vision set by the mayor was a strong call to advance open and transparent government.”

Two years later, the city has made notable progress on these goals. From an [executive order](http://www.phila.gov/EXECUTIVE_ORDERS/pdfs/executive%20orders/10.%20Mayor%20Nutter/2012/EO112.pdf) establishing an open data policy to being the sole city selected as a Code for America partner two years running, Philadelphia has garnered a reputation as a city at the forefront of the open government movement.

“The executive order opened up so many possibilities for us,” Friedman said. “We’ve been able to move very quickly on these issues in short amount of time.”

Friedman is known as a catalyst in helping facilitate this progress.

“Jeff is a change agent in the mayor’s office,” said Michelle Lee, a 2012 Code for America fellow working with the City of Philadelphia. “He helped us navigate the city bureaucracy and made sure we knew all of Philadelphia&#8211;not just downtown.”

In his role, Friedman is spearheading the development of <a href="http://www.openaccessphilly.com/" target="_blank">OpenAccessPhilly</a>, a strategic plan for public programs that includes a focus on connecting citizens with each other and with government, digital inclusion, and economic development in the technology sector.

The initiative is modeled after the City’s Greenworks program.

  * The first tenant of the plan is targeted at providing Philadelphians with the data, information, and applications they need to advance meaningful change in their neighborhoods.
  * The second tenant is geared at identifying and fulfilling infrastructure, connectivity, and content needs so that all Philadelphians have the opportunity to connect digitally.
  * The third tenant focuses on removing roadblocks and providing incentives for the IT producing and using sectors to grow and attract infotec businesses.

For Friedman, working at the intersection of technology and government has provided inspiration.

“I hadn’t done anything like this before so it seemed like a stretch and a challenge,” said Friedman.  “Learning from technologists, entrepreneurs, and hackers changes my understanding of what’s possible.”

As a non-coder, Friedman says a large part of his appreciation for technology comes from a business angle.

“I don’t know how to code,” Friedman said. “I’m really interested in using tools in a lighter way to get information and input to move forward.”

It seems Philadelphia is just getting started.

“Where I see myself and the city using tech is to cultivate civic engagement and participation,” Friedman said. “We’re using tech to get things done.”

We here at Code for America certainly think so.****
