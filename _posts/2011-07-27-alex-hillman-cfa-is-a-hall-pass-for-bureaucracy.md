Yesterday, co-founder of [Indy Hall](http://indyhall.org/) Alex Hillman ([@alexknowshtml](http://twitter.com/#!/alexknowshtml)) wrote up a terrific article about Code for America and its effect on Philadelphia on his blog _[dangerouslyawesome](http://dangerouslyawesome.com/). __

Here&#8217;s an excerpt of [&#8220;A Hall Pass for Bureaucracy &#8211; Code for America Philadelphia&#8221;](http://dangerouslyawesome.com/2011/07/a-hall-pass-for-bureaucracy-code-for-america-philadelphia/):

> _When I first heard about Code for America, what intrigued me the most was the concept of a “bolt-on” group of individuals who ultimately have to abide by the rules of operating within government and the civic ecosystem, but at the same time, are given a bit of a “hall pass” to move through the layers of bureaucracy&#8230; I think that the CFA process helped prime the pumps for the continued development of a new style of trusting relationship between city hall and citizens._

Definitely read the whole post, as Alex makes a smart and well-written case for pushing the citizen-government relationship forward. We&#8217;re thrilled to be a part of it!
