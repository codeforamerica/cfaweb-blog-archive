_This post originally appeared on 2014 Fellow [Jason Dezinac&#8217;s blog](http://log.jden.us/post/93798959727/highway-to-the-data-zone). The Open Data Roadshow is heading to Mesa, AZ on September 4, 2014. [RSVP by Monday, September 1, to join.](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/open-data-roadshow-mesa-tickets-12361508605)_

Four Code for America Fellows, 3 days, 2 LTE hotspots, and 1 van. I’m writing from the middle of almond groves and wind farms just outside of Fresno, California, driving south on I-5 to San Diego. It’s called the Open Data Roadshow, and we’re racking up miles talking with people about open data.

The daylong drive is a perfect excuse to spend time with Fellows from other teams and talk about our experiences on the front lines of open data. What challenges are cities facing? What motivates people working in local government IT departments to do the hard work of opening data? What common obstacles could be overcome with better tools, policies, or processes?

On this trip we’ll attend the Accela Engage user conference to see first hand how cities are integrating open data practices into their existing data management workflows and line-of-business systems.

We’re also putting on an open data workshop with the City of San Diego alongside the San Diego Code for America Brigade. We’ll be joined by startups built around open data: Civic Insight and SCOUTred. Co-merge in San Diego generously donated their co-working space to hold the workshop. The workshop is intended for government staff, entrepreneurs, and any members of the community interested in open data.

**The rubber meets the road**

Open data describes an end state, with a clear definition around licensing, availability, and technical format accessibility — but the road to open data can be bumpy and winding. As proponents, believers, and practitioners of open data we must work at opening data and share our tools and experiences to create a community of practice. We need to create forums for talking about the whys, the hows, and the what-nexts of open data. So we’re hitting the road and increasing connections between open data advocates across the country.

There’s not a single playbook for opening up data, and getting there is not a direct process. When driving, the road appears linear and the GPS counts down the miles to the destination. But the road system is a network, with many possible routes and approaches to reach the same goal. By sharing paths that have worked for others, we can help more people and more cities navigate this new terrain.

In the early days of the United States, judges rode from town to town to provide infrastructure for our justice system. These “circuit riders” made up the US Circuit Courts and helped ensure the expedient and consistent application of justice under the law. Open data is maturing, but we are still in early days. As open data circuit riders, we are listening to what’s working and what’s not working and helping spread those ideas.
