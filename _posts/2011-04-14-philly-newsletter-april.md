Over the month of February, Code for America&#8217;s Philadelphia Team was able to hold 105 interviews with 180 individuals. Many of you receiving this email were one of those interviewees. The entire team at Code for America would like to thank you for spending your time with us. The information we collected in these interviews is a very important part of the process to create technologies that will improve the City of Philadelphia.

That process too will rely on your involvement. We spent the month of March reading through every interview, comparing notes with the Seattle team, and searching for commonalities and problem areas. Next, we held an &#8220;inception event&#8221; with the city staff to take those problem areas into project ideas, which we then researched to see what we could deploy and what we needed to build. We&#8217;re thrilled to share both a summary of the inception and our tech review with you below, and we&#8217;re eager to hear your feedback and thoughts.

Our inception event was a chance for Team Philadelphia and Team Seattle (now Team Pheattle) to come together with our civic stakeholders and talk about what we felt we could build to accomplish the task they&#8217;ve given us. You can read <a style="color: #de3b4f;" href="http://schrier.wordpress.com/2011/03/25/the-inception-event-cfa/">a great blog post</a> by Seattle&#8217;s CIO, Bill Schrier about the event itself. In short, Team Pheattle pitched five ideas to CfA staff and the civic stakeholders. We then voted on which of those ideas best suited our given project. We hashed out the details of the ideas with our feet and then voted with PostIt notes. The winners: The Engagement Toolkit and OpenCalendar (names not final). We had a lot of fun and the event ended with much excitement around the genesis of a solution.

After the inception ended we needed to see what kinds of technologies are in existence that would help us build the Engagement Toolkit and OpenCalendar. Is there a tool out there that accomplishes all our goals? What open-source solutions exist that we can utilize? What are these products doing well that we can learn from? Those are some of the questions we asked during our &#8220;tech review&#8221;. By researching existing technologies and systematically shoving them through a gauntlet of questions we were able to determine some functionalities that we will want to include in our products.

What are you doing April 25th &#8211; 30th? <a style="color: #de3b4f;" href="www.technicallyphilly.com">Technically Philly</a> has a heck of an agenda planned for the first official Philly Tech Week (PTW). Highlighting the week is a big unveiling by <a style="color: #de3b4f;" href="http://phillytechweek.com/">OpenDataPhilly</a> on the 25th. Also, look for a speaker series, hack-a-thons and happy hours. Check out the line up <a style="color: #de3b4f;" href="http://technicallyphilly.com/2011/04/05/philly-tech-week-update-free-lunchtime-speaker-series-event-details-reservations-and-more">here</a>.

<span style="font-size: 15px; font-weight: bold; color: #333333; font-family: arial; line-height: 150%;">Welcome America Site</span>
  
It might look almost exactly the same as last years site but that&#8217;s what the Welcome America team asked us to help them with. **John Mertens** and **Pete Fecteau** have spent the last couple weeks turning <a style="color: #de3b4f;" href="http://welcomeamerica.com">welcomeamerica.com</a> into a <a style="color: #de3b4f;" href="www.wordpress.org">WordPress</a> install. They tore apart the old site and recreated it on the popular blogging platform which will ultimately offer a faster and more dynamic approach to content generation. No small task.

<span style="font-size: 15px; font-weight: bold; color: #333333; font-family: arial; line-height: 150%;">Newlyweds!</span>
  
We wanted to give a quick congratulations to fellow Mjumbe Poe and his new bride Jennifer Williams. The two were married March 12th in Bethany Beach, DE. We wish the the two the best luck in their new lives together. Cheers!

There once was a king who lived in a two-story grass hut. Every holiday the king demanded to be given a new throne as a gift. As soon as a new throne arrived, he would store the old throne on the second level of his hut and use the new one instead. But one day the hut collapsed from the weight of all the thrones, and everyone was crushed and killed.

The moral of this story? **Those who live in grass houses shouldn&#8217;t stow thrones.**
