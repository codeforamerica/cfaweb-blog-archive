In the past 5 years, there has been enormous growth in the government technology ecosystem. Not only have new vendors offering cost savings and entered the market, we’ve also seen governments embracing new approaches to buying and building technology, Brigades working hand-in-hand with their local governments to make important digital services more usable, and significant investments in government technology from venture capital firms.

In our [Principles for Government Technology](http://www.codeforamerica.org/governments/principles/government-technology/), we’ve documented the seven principles that we think are most important for promoting good digital products and practices in government technology. We think these principles characterize how successful governments, vendors, and products work together to deliver 21st century government — and as the ecosystem continues to grow, we’ve been thrilled to see more and more examples of these principles in action.

That’s why we’re launching the [Code for America Technology Awards](http://awards.codeforamerica.org/) to recognize outstanding 21st century government technology. With the Technology Awards, we hope to elevate the best examples of government technology that align with our principles and have had significant impact on delivering better government services — and encourage further adoption of these tools and practices by other governments.

[Applications](http://awards.codeforamerica.org/) are open starting today until July 13, 2015. We’ll announce the winners at this year’s [Code for America Summit](https://www.codeforamerica.org/summit/). Companies, governments, individuals, Brigades, and anyone who is building or implementing software for the public sector in the U.S is encouraged to apply.

To help us select the awardees, we’ve pulled together an amazing group of judges with expertise in government technology, including government staff, investors, entrepreneurs, and academics.
