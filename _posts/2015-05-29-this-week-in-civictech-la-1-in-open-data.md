## Open Twin Cities Hacks to End Veteran Homelessness

Minnesota launches an [ambitious program to house every homeless veteran](http://kstp.com/article/stories/s3727176.shtml) in the State within 300 days. Last year, Open Twin Cities worked with the state&#8217;s IT agency and the Interagency Council on Homelessness to [throw a hackathon on these issues](http://opentwincities.org/2014/07/16/hack-for-mn-2014-heading-home-projects/). The ideas from that event directly influenced the Minnesota&#8217;s new program.
