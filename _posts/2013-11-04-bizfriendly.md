  Meet <a href="http://bizfriend.ly">BizFriend.ly</a>, an online resource where entrepreneurs can find free, easy-to-use tools to help them start, run, and grow their businesses.
</p>



<p dir="ltr">
  <a href="http://bizfriend.ly">BizFriend.ly</a> was created as part of a year-long partnership between Kansas City, Mo. and the Unified Government of Wyandotte County and  Kansas City, Kan., and Code for America. Working in close collaboration with representatives from both governments, Code for America Fellows, Andrew Hyder and myself, were asked to explore economic development issues and opportunities, with the specific goals of making City Hall more entrepreneurial and better able to serve the growing community of entrepreneurs.
</p>

When we found out we would spend our Fellowship year in Kansas City, we were excited to join the community of people building cutting edge technology on top of [Google Fiber](https://fiber.google.com/). Through our research we uncovered more immediate challenges Kansas City was facing related to this important piece of infrastructure; a digital divide in access and skills. We realized that they were uniquely positioned to engage in the digital access and skills conversation by working in the Mayors’ offices and we found an opportunity for rethinking economic development through digital education and we have worked throughout the year with the city and community to create a new civic resource for entrepreneurs to make sure that they are not digitally left behind.

> “There are many issues that cross state boundaries and economic development is one of them. This regional collaboration through technology is a first in municipal government and shows that government doesn’t have to be an impediment but instead, is a useful conduit of prosperity.”

  We want to take this opportunity to thank Kansas City and our amazing community sponsors for partnering with Code for America this year. The Mayors’ Offices and local community partners, including The Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation, Google Fiber, Cerner, Sprint, Hall Family Foundation, Hallmark Corporate, and H&R Block Foundation, invested in bringing Code for America to Kansas City this year. The investment made in this new civic resource is another step in making KCK and KCMO two of the most digitally literate communities in the country.
