[<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-12598" title="CfA_Salon" src="http://codeforamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/CfA_Salon1.png" alt="" />](http://codeforamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/CfA_Salon1.png)CfA Salon is a new casual speaker series hosted by Code for America. This monthly event invites the community in for a thought-provoking, intimate discussion with leaders in government and technology. These leaders will share their vision for where we are and where we&#8217;re heading as a society. Code for America will share a bit about the current goings-on with the Fellowship, Accelerator, and Brigade.

On May 7, 2012 we&#8217;ll kickoff of the CfA Salon with a candid conversationÂ with Ellen Miller, co-founder and executive director of the <a href="http://sunlightfoundation.com/" target="_blank">Sunlight Foundation</a>, one of the world&#8217;s leading transparency and open government organizations, and Tom Steinberg, founder and director of <a href="http://mysociety.org/" target="_blank">mySociety</a>, the UK&#8217;s innovative civic engagement and accountability development organization. Ellen and Tom will be joined by Jennifer Pahlka, CfA&#8217;s founder and executive director, for a candid discussion about open government, open data, and citizenship.
