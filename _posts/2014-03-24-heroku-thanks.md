This past year [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) continued their support of Code for America’s civic projects by generously donating $20,000 of in-kind credits for CfA’s app development.

From powering the backend infrastructure of an application to help [San Franciscan&#8217;s keep their food benefits](http://www.codeforamerica.org/apps/promptly/), to [teaching web literacy to Kansas City small business owners](http://www.codeforamerica.org/apps/bizfriendly/), to helping San Mateo County create an [open framework to track community organizations](http://www.codeforamerica.org/apps/ohana-api/) &mdash; Heroku is helping Code for America Fellows build the future of civic technology.

### The Power of the Partnership

In 2013, the City of Oakland recognized the need to digitize and improve its public records program. At the time, requests were not well tracked, City staff were often unable to navigate the system, and the information that did exist was buried. In essence, the system was a black hole and staff found themselves answering the same requests over and over. It’s for this reason that 2013 Code for America Fellowship team Richa Agarwal, Cris Cristina, and Sheila Dugan built [RecordTrac](http://records.oaklandnet.com/) to archive and manage public records requests.

From prototype to production, the app has been hosted by Heroku. The app is now used by every department in the City,  with backend administration managed by the city&#8217;s IT department. This application and its development have been so successful that Cristina and Agarwal have since cofounded a consulting group called [Postcode](http://www.postcode.io/) to facilitate the redeployment of RecordTrac to other local governments.

Code for America is grateful to the Heroku team for their generous in-kind donation and partnership over the years. Thank you for helping make our work possible!
