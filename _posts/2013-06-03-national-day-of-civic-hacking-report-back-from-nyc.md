**This past weekend, the New York City metro area hosted five <a href="http://hackforchange.org/events" target="_blank">National Day of Civic Hacking events</a>! (<a href="http://hackforchange.org/edesign-lab-open-source-k12-education-hackathon" target="_blank">Two in Manhattan</a>, <a href="http://hackforchange.org/nycpublicorgs-designhackathon-creating-power-tools-public-school-parents" target="_blank">one in Brooklyn</a>, <a href="http://hackforchange.org/rockaway-beach-civic-hack-day" target="_blank">one in Queens</a>, and <a href="http://hackforchange.org/hacknwk-city-website-redesign" target="_blank">one in Newark, N.J</a>.) One of them was the City&#8217;s first CityCamp and the last public event before the conclusion of NYC BigApps.**

After three months of civic hackers working on solving <a href="http://nycbigapps.com/bigissues" target="_blank">NYC&#8217;s biggest issues</a>, <a href="http://nycbigapps.com" target="_blank">NYC BigApps 2013</a> hosted NYC&#8217;s first CityCamp. Participants hacked and polished their projects, while the general public explored NYC&#8217;s civic technology ecosystem and beta tested <a href="http://nycbigapps.com/project" target="_blank">BigApp projects</a>.

At the end of the day, BigApps participants celebrated the near conclusion of the competition with the first ever Demo Night. In front of a panel of esteemed judges, 11 BigApps projects demoed fully functionally projects and four four honors were awarded.
